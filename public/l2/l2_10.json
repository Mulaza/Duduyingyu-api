        "sentence": "See that leaf moving in the wind? Look again. It is an insect. It just looks like a leaf! Hungry birds do not know it is a bug. They do not try to eat it. Some butterflies look like dried leaves. They rest with their wings together to match the real leaves around them. The colorful parts of their wings are hidden until they fly away. Another bug that wears a costume is the stick insect. It looks like its name—a stick! This insect hides in the leaves and twigs of a tree. It can turn green or brown to match the colors around it. Some stick insects are tiny. Others are a foot long. Insects are very clever. Maybe the next time you take a walk, you will see one pretending to be something else.",
