        "sentence": "It’s a sunny Saturday. Let’s take a picnic to the park. What should we pack? We’ll need some things besides food. A blanket to sit on would be good. Napkins will keep our clothes and fingers clean. It would be smart to bring a sweater or jacket along in case a cool breeze blows. Now it’s time to pack the food. Sandwiches are good for picnics. They are easy to hold. You can pack them in little bags. Fruit makes a nice treat. Apples, oranges, and bananas are all easy to eat. Let’s take some chips and cookies, too. Oh, don’t forget to bring drinks along for when we start to get thirsty. A ball to play catch with might be a good idea, too. If it is breezy, we can fly a kite. Let’s take a music player. We can dance to our favorite tunes. With tasty food and fun things to do, we are sure to have fun!",
