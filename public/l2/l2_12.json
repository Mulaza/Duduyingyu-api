        "sentence": "Most cars run on gasoline, or “gas” for short. Gas cars work very well. There is a problem, though. Cars that run on gas make the air dirty. This dirty air is not good for people, animals, or trees. Gas cars make the air dirty for all living things. What can we do? We can drive electric cars! Electric cars do not use gas. These cars do not make the air dirty. These cars have battery packs that power their motors. The batteries can be charged many times. They can be used again and again. This makes electric cars great. But electric cars have problems, too. They are slower than gas cars. They are also very quiet. This means that some people cannot hear them when they drive by. These people may not think a car is coming. They have to be careful. People are finding ways to make electric cars better all the time. Maybe someday all cars will be electric. That would be much better for the world.",
