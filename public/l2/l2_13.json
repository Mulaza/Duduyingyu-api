        "sentence": "Seeds need some of the same things that we need. They need food, water, air, and sunshine. They need room to grow. They also need time to grow. If the tiny seed gets what it needs, it will grow into a plant. Slowly, the seed sends a root down into the soil. This root pulls water up to the seed. It works like a straw. Next, the seed will slowly push up a tiny green shoot. That shoot will break through the ground. You will see it peeking through the soil. Then, the shoot will begin to grow leaves. The new plant is called a seedling. It will grow into a bigger plant. Then, flowers will grow on the plant’s stems. The flowers will open. The flowers will be very pretty. The flowers will make new seeds. The seeds will fall to the ground and start to grow. Soon they will push up through the ground. They will become new plants!",
