        "sentence": "Last year in California, a team of tree cutters were sent to a job. A row of tall trees along a city road needed to be cut down. The trees were beautiful, but they were sick. They were dropping big branches. The branches were dangerous for cars on the road below. The workers started to cut down the trees. They cut down the first tree. They cut down the second and third trees. Then a worker climbed the fourth tree to cut off its lowest branch. He saw something surprising. Tucked into a hole in the tree were five baby barn owls! The worker climbed down the tree. He told the other workers about the baby owls. They cut down the other trees. They did not cut down the tree that had the baby owls in it. They waited. They waited until the owls were older. They did not cut down the tree until the owls flew away.",
