        "sentence": "The Statue of Liberty stands on a small island in New York Harbor. People who come to this country on ships see Lady Liberty standing there. She welcomes them at the end of their long trip across the sea. The statue holds a torch high above her head. The torch stands for freedom. France gave the statue to our country as a gift of friendship. It was made in France. It came across the ocean in pieces. Then it was put together here. The statue is made of copper and steel. It is as tall as a building with 30 floors. The statue’s face is very big. The nose is as long as your body. The fingers are about as long as the ceiling in a room is high! There are stairs inside of the statue. People climb 354 steps to get to the crown. Thirty people can fit in the crown. There are 25 windows in it. They can see the ships that the statue is welcoming.",
