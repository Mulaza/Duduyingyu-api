        "sentence": "“Wake up, everyone! It snowed last night,” Niko called. A smile spread across his face. Niko opened the front door. Icy air rushed into the warm room. The world outside was white and soft. The car in the driveway looked like a great big pillow. The pine trees were wearing big white snow hats. Everything sparkled. Niko was putting on his jacket and boots when his brother ran in. “Hooray for snow!” he yelled. “Where are my gloves?” “Come back soon for breakfast,” the boys’ mother said. There were pancakes on the table when the boys came back into the house. They dropped their jackets by the door and sat down at the table. “Thanks, Mom!” Niko said. “We found a new place to sled.” “We are going to make a snowman!” Niko’s brother said. The boys’ mother laughed and said, “There’s nothing like snow.”",
