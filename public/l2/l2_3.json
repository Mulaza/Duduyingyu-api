His real name was Theodor Seuss Geisel (GUY-zul ). When Theodor went to college, he wrote for a magazine. He wrote funny things. His friends thought he was funny. A few years later, he began to write books for children. He was very good at art. He drew funny pictures for his books. One book is The Cat in the Hat. Another one is Hop on Pop. Dr. Seuss’s books are different from other books. Books by Dr. Seuss are silly. They are fun to read. Some of them show make-believe animals like the zizzer zazzer zuzz. Young children laugh when their parents and teachers read these books to them. Older children enjoy reading them alone.",
