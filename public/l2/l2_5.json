They needed help with their daughter. Their little girl’s name was Helen Keller. Helen needed a teacher.Helen could not see. She could not hear either. She felt scared and alone. Annie wanted to help Helen. She wanted to be able to talk to her.Annie tried to teach Helen sign language, a way to make words with your hands. But Helen did not understand what Annie tried to teach her.One day by the outside water pump, Annie had an idea. She held one of Helen’s hands in the water. Then Annie traced W-A-T-E-R on Helen’s other hand again and again and again.At last, Helen understood. She learned that what she was feeling had a name. Helen was on her way to a lifetime of learning.",
