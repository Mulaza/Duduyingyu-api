But an elephant named Tarra chose a dog for her best friend! Tarra and her dog friend, Bella, go everywhere together. The two friends eat together. They sleep together, too. One day, Bella hurt her back. She needed to rest. She rested inside the office of the people who care for the elephants. Bella rested for three weeks. She rested until her back was better. While Bella rested, Tarra stood by a gate outside the office. She stood and stood. The nice people carried Bella out to see Tarra. Bella’s tail wagged. The two friends visited every day until Bella could walk again. Tarra and Bella are together again. To show her love, the elephant pets Bella’s tummy with her great big foot!",
