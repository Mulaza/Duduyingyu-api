        "sentence": "Deep in the ocean, it is very dark. Not much sunlight can go that far down. The fish in this water make their own light. The lights are part of their bodies. One kind of fish that makes light is the lanternfish. They are thin and small. Some are as short as a finger. The larger ones are as long as your arm. Some lanternfish are blue, green, or silver. The ones in the deepest water are brown or black. A yellow, green, or blue light shines from along their sides. Another fish that makes its own light is the anglerfish. The anglerfish is round like a ball. It is brown, gray, or black. Its mouth can open very wide, and its teeth are long and sharp. The light on the anglerfish is blue-green. It grows out of its forehead and waves back and forth. The fish uses this light to get its food. Smaller fish swim to the light. Snap! Fish with lights are one of the many wonders of our world.",
