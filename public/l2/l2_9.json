        "sentence": "Fire in a forest can do much harm. Forest fires burn many trees. They burn animals’ homes. Some even burn people’s houses. Fires can be terrible, but they do some good things, too. Fires clear the forest floor. They get rid of old, dry branches. This helps keep more fires from starting. Fires make new holes in trees where birds can nest. They also make more room for new trees to grow. Some pine cones need fire. They do not let go of their seeds without it. In forest fires, the cones drop seeds that become new baby trees. This makes the forest new. A forest fire can be both bad and good.",
