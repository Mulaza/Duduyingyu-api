        "sentence": "An archerfish can get its food in two ways. It can leap out of the water to snag a bug. Or it can stay in the water and shoot down its food by spitting a jet of water. The fish begins the attack by first swimming near a low branch. It stays underwater but close to the surface. Only the tip of its mouth sticks out of the water. Next, the fish waits for a bug to land on the branch. When the bug lands, the archerfish acts quickly. First, the fish presses its tongue against a groove on the roof of its mouth. This makes a narrow tube. Then, it snaps its gills shut. This action forces water into its mouth and out the tube. Zap! The jet of water hits the bug, which falls into the water. With a gulp, the archerfish finally eats its meal.",
