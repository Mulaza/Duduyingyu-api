        "sentence": "Some people think earthworms are yucky. I think earthworms are a farmer\u2019s best friend. To grow healthy plants, a farmer needs healthy soil. Earthworms help make soil healthy and rich. These wiggly critters live in the ground where it is moist and cool. They move by digging tunnels. Each time earthworms wiggle, they mix and sift the soil. This loosens the dirt so that plants can spread their roots. The worms\u2019 digging actions also bring air into the soil, which plants need to live. Earthworms eat tiny bits of plants and dead bugs. The droppings that earthworms deposit are nutrients. They make the soil rich for growing fruits and vegetables. I think farmers will agree with me. Earthworms are amazing creatures!",
