        "sentence": "In the 1800s, people moved to the West in covered wagons. Mules or oxen pulled the wagons. Families piled their furniture and belongings inside. Because the wagons were so full, there was no room in the wagon for sleeping. Traveling was an adventure. The wagons were not comfortable to ride in because the wagon wheels were covered in iron, not rubber. Roads made wagons more uncomfortable because they were bumpy and not paved. People who did not drive the wagon walked beside it. The roads were rugged, but they did help with one daily chore. Women or children milked their cows in the morning. Then they poured some fresh milk into a wooden butter churn. They hung the container on the wagon. The wagon bounced so much that by night, the churn held a lump of butter.",
