{"lesson": {"type": "sentence", "title": "Rub That Mud!", "sentence": "Baseball teams use a lot of new balls in every game. Each team must have 90 on hand. The balls are white and shiny when they get to the park. But they are not shiny when the game begins. This is because shiny balls are slippery to throw. Pitchers might hurt the batters with wild pitches. So each ball is rubbed with a special mud. The mud makes the balls safer to use. All the baseball teams use the same mud. It is made and sold by one company. First, a crew goes to a secret location. Next, they dig up hundreds of pounds of muck. Then, they rinse the mud to get rid of rocks. Some secret ingredients are added. They make the mud feel like creamy pudding. Finally, the mud is stored in barrels. After six to eight weeks, the mud is ready to send to the ballparks. One worker at each park takes care of the new balls. The worker adds water to a dab of mud and rubs it onto each ball. About an hour later, over 100 balls are ready for play.", "key_words": [{"word": "word", "translation": "--", "speech": "\u540d\u8bcd", "example": "N/A"}, {"word": "word", "translation": "--", "speech": "\u540d\u8bcd", "example": "N/A"}]}, "test": [{"type": "scq", "sentence": "Why do workers rub special mud on baseballs", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "So the ball is harder to hit", "value": "So the ball is harder to hit"}, {"text_en": "So the ball is a brighter color", "value": "So the ball is a brighter color"}, {"text_en": "So the ball is safer to use", "value": "So the ball is safer to use"}, {"text_en": "So the ball is slippery", "value": "So the ball is slippery"}]}, {"type": "scq", "sentence": "What is the next step after secret ingredients are added to the mud", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "The mud is rinsed", "value": "The mud is rinsed"}, {"text_en": "The mud is sold", "value": "The mud is sold"}, {"text_en": "The mud sits in barrels", "value": "The mud sits in barrels"}, {"text_en": "More mud is dug up.", "value": "More mud is dug up."}]}, {"type": "scq", "sentence": "Which step comes before rinsing the mud", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "Making the mud feel like pudding", "value": "Making the mud feel like pudding"}, {"text_en": "Storing the mud in barrels", "value": "Storing the mud in barrels"}, {"text_en": "Selling the mud to teams", "value": "Selling the mud to teams"}, {"text_en": "Digging up the muck", "value": "Digging up the muck"}]}, {"type": "scq", "sentence": "Who performs the final step in getting the shine off the baseballs", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "A worker at each park", "value": "A worker at each park"}, {"text_en": "The company that makes the mud", "value": "The company that makes the mud"}, {"text_en": "The crew that digs up the mud", "value": "The crew that digs up the mud"}, {"text_en": "A worker for all of the teams", "value": "A worker for all of the teams"}]}]}
