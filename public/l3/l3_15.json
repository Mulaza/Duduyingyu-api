        "sentence": "Grace is no ordinary four-year-old. Grace dunks basketballs and plays the piano. And she\u2019s an artist, too. Grace holds a brush between her big front teeth and paints pictures. People buy her paintings, and the money is given to the poor. Yes, Grace is very clever, especially for a mule. Mules usually do as they please. But that\u2019s not Grace. Steve Foster, her owner, says that Grace is a fast learner. She uses the different sounds of his voice to know and follow his commands. Grace may be the smartest mule in the world! Being smart helped her get a part in a movie. She appears in the film Get Low and plays a mule, of course. Because Grace plays an old mule, she wears makeup. Her face has white and gray coloring.",
