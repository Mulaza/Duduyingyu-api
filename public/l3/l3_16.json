        "sentence": "Boas are large, powerful snakes. Some types of boas are as long as 18 feet. Boas are found mostly in forests in parts of Mexico and South America. They live on the ground, in trees, and in or near water. Boas are good swimmers. They also can climb trees, twist around branches, and hang by their tails. Their body colors and skin patterns blend into the trees. Boas are meat eaters. They hunt at night for small animals and birds. They first grab their prey with their teeth. Then they squeeze their prey to kill it. They swallow their food whole and do not chew. All boas have strong muscles that help them move and help them eat.",
