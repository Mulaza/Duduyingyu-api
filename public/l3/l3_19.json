        "sentence": "The spider laughed with excitement. She was ready to build her very first web. The place between the tree branches was perfect. So the spider did exactly as her mother had shown her. The spider pulled a thread of silk from her body. She tugged hard to make it strong. Then she focused on her work. Back and forth, up and down, and around and around the spider dashed. She transformed her silk into an orb web with a spiral center. Feeling very pleased, the spider did not stop. She began to try other shapes. By nightfall, she had spun webs that looked like the Statue of Liberty and the Empire State Building. \u201cBugs on vacation will want to visit these,\u201d she chuckled.",
