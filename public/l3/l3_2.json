        "sentence": "Evan lived in the city. More than anything, he wanted to ride a horse. He could hardly wait to gallop as fast as the wind. Evan visited Uncle Pete at his farm. His uncle was ready to show Evan how to ride. Evan sat on a fence as his uncle walked a horse toward him. The ground seemed to shake with every step the horse took. Evan dug his fingernails into the fence. He stared at the huge beast. \u201cWere all horses this big?\u201d he wondered. Uncle Pete helped Evan onto the horse\u2019s back. Then Evan tapped the horse\u2019s sides with his heels. The horse began to trot. Evan bounced up and down like a jumping frog. \u201cRiding a horse hurts,\u201d said Evan. He decided to forget about galloping. For now, the speed of a merry-go-round seemed just right.",
