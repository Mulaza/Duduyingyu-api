        "sentence": "Earth\u2019s top and bottom are more different than alike. The Arctic is the farthest place north. It is an icy ocean surrounded by land. Antarctica is the farthest place south. It is a frozen land surrounded by ocean. Both places are too cold to rain. Very little snow falls in either place because the air is as dry as a desert. Large areas of land surround the Arctic Ocean. The land closest to the Arctic is always frozen deep down into the soil. But in the summer, the weather is mild. Some plants grow then, and wolves, foxes, and birds feed on them. Unlike the Arctic, all of Antarctica is covered in ice that never melts. It is the coldest place on Earth. Only tiny insects live there. But sea animals live in the icy ocean around Antarctica. Emperor penguins live on ice packs near the coast.",
