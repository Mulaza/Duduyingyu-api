{"lesson": {"type": "sentence", "title": "How Paper Straws Were Invented", "sentence": "The first drinking straws grew outdoors. People broke off a piece of hollow grass. They plunked it into their cold lemonade and then sipped. Holding a glass with warm hands warmed the drink. So the grass helped keep the lemonade cold. But, ripe grass also changed how the lemonade tasted. Marvin Stone wanted something that worked better than grass. He liked working with paper. So, he wrapped a strip of paper around a pencil. He glued the edges closed. Sure enough, his paper drinking straw worked. He then tried thicker paper that he covered in a thin wax. That paper did not fall apart in a drink. Mr. Stone experimented with different sizes of straws. He decided that 8\u00bd inches was the perfect length for a straw. He found the best width, too. It let the drink through but kept lemonade seeds out.", "key_words": [{"word": "word", "translation": "--", "speech": "\u540d\u8bcd", "example": "N/A"}, {"word": "word", "translation": "--", "speech": "\u540d\u8bcd", "example": "N/A"}]}, "test": [{"type": "scq", "sentence": "The first paragraph is mostly about ", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "Using grass as straws", "value": "Using grass as straws"}, {"text_en": "The invention of paper straws", "value": "The invention of paper straws"}, {"text_en": "Grass that makes lemonade taste bad", "value": "Grass that makes lemonade taste bad"}, {"text_en": "The problem with grass straws", "value": "The problem with grass straws"}]}, {"type": "scq", "sentence": "The second paragraph is mostly about ", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "The size of paper straws", "value": "The size of paper straws"}, {"text_en": "Marvin stones many inventions", "value": "Marvin stones many inventions"}, {"text_en": "The invention of the paper straw", "value": "The invention of the paper straw"}, {"text_en": "The paper used in making straws", "value": "The paper used in making straws"}]}, {"type": "scq", "sentence": "Why did marvin stone cover the paper straw in thin wax", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "So the straw would shine in the drink", "value": "So the straw would shine in the drink"}, {"text_en": "So the straw would last", "value": "So the straw would last"}, {"text_en": "So the straw would work like grass", "value": "So the straw would work like grass"}, {"text_en": "So the straw would keep out seeds", "value": "So the straw would keep out seeds"}]}, {"type": "scq", "sentence": "Which one is the best title for the passage", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "How to make a paper straw", "value": "How to make a paper straw"}, {"text_en": "How paper straws were invented", "value": "How paper straws were invented"}, {"text_en": "Lemonade and straws", "value": "Lemonade and straws"}, {"text_en": "The first straws", "value": "The first straws"}]}]}
