        "sentence": "Mia\u2019s elbows were leaned on the kitchen table. She sat with her chin in her hands and her eyes looking down. A plate of cookies was in front of her. Like all third-graders, Mia liked summer vacation. But when there was nothing to do, she got bored. As Mia munched on a cookie, she knew just what to do. She would bake something. \u201cFollowing directions is easy,\u201d thought Mia. Mia found a cookbook and chose a recipe for a rich, gooey chocolate cake. She was excited. This was Mia\u2019s first attempt to bake by herself. She grabbed bottles, bags, and bowls. She mixed and poured at lightning speed. After the cake had baked, Mia cut herself a big slice. Ugh! It was the worst cake Mia had ever eaten. She must have used salt instead of sugar! So that she wouldn\u2019t make a mistake next time, Mia decided she would work slowly and carefully.",
