        "sentence": "What if you wanted to make a scary movie about a plant that grew out of control? What would that plant be like? Would it climb light poles and telephone wires? Would it wrap around trees and crawl all over fields? Would it climb tall buildings and cover a house until that house looks like a giant bush? There is a plant like that in the southern United States. It\u2019s called kudzu, and it can grow a foot a day! Some people say if you stand still long enough, kudzu will grow all over you! About 100 years ago, people liked kudzu. Farmers fed it to their cows. They planted it in their fields. The plant\u2019s strong roots kept the soil from washing away. People liked the shade the vines provided from the summer sun. After a time, people saw that nothing stopped kudzu from growing. The weather did not get cold enough to hurt the plant. Insects did not care to eat it. Now, people think kudzu grows too well. They think it is the worst plant in the world.",
