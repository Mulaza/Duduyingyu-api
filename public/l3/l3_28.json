{"lesson": {"type": "sentence", "title": "Deep In The Sea", "sentence": "Deep in the sea, the water is almost black. The sun\u2019s rays do not reach down that far. Creepy creatures live in the dark ocean depths. Some deep-sea fish create their own light so that they can see in the darkness. Chemicals in their bodies make their body parts glow. Some fish have rows of flashing lights along their bodies. Those lights scare off an attacker. Other fish have very long threads that grow from their jaw or lips. The threads end in a ball of light. These fish wiggle their lights to attract food. Curious fish swim to the light and become a meal. This is the best way to catch food. Many deep-sea fish have huge mouths and teeth to help them catch fish. Gulper eels can unhook their jaws. It looks gross, but it lets their mouths open very wide. A viperfish has teeth that are so long and sharp that it can\u2019t close its mouth. Those teeth make a viperfish look scarier than a shark.", "key_words": [{"word": "word", "translation": "--", "speech": "\u540d\u8bcd", "example": "N/A"}, {"word": "word", "translation": "--", "speech": "\u540d\u8bcd", "example": "N/A"}]}, "test": [{"type": "scq", "sentence": "Which of these is an opinion", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "Deep-sea water is almost black", "value": "Deep-sea water is almost black"}, {"text_en": "Deep-sea fish have huge mouths", "value": "Deep-sea fish have huge mouths"}, {"text_en": "Some deep-sea fish are creepy", "value": "Some deep-sea fish are creepy"}, {"text_en": "Some deep-sea fish glow.", "value": "Some deep-sea fish glow."}]}, {"type": "scq", "sentence": "Which of these is a fact", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "Viperfish are scary creatures", "value": "Viperfish are scary creatures"}, {"text_en": "A viperfish cannot close its mouth", "value": "A viperfish cannot close its mouth"}, {"text_en": "Using a light is the best way to catch fish", "value": "Using a light is the best way to catch fish"}, {"text_en": "Gulper eels look gross.", "value": "Gulper eels look gross."}]}, {"type": "scq", "sentence": "Which of these is an opinion", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "Some fish have rows of flashing lights", "value": "Some fish have rows of flashing lights"}, {"text_en": "The best way for fish to catch food is to wiggle their lights", "value": "The best way for fish to catch food is to wiggle their lights"}, {"text_en": "Some fish show their long teeth", "value": "Some fish show their long teeth"}, {"text_en": "Eels unhook their jaws so they can open their mouths wide.", "value": "Eels unhook their jaws so they can open their mouths wide."}]}, {"type": "scq", "sentence": "Which one is true about fish in the deep sea", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "The fish with lights are better than the fish with big teeth", "value": "The fish with lights are better than the fish with big teeth"}, {"text_en": "Their bodies help them live in the dark", "value": "Their bodies help them live in the dark"}, {"text_en": "The fish look like monsters", "value": "The fish look like monsters"}, {"text_en": "The fish are scarier than sharks.", "value": "The fish are scarier than sharks."}]}]}
