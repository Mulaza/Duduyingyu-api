        "sentence": "An elephant\u2019s trunk is the world\u2019s most useful nose. The trunk is used to drink, eat, smell, bathe, and greet other elephants! Elephants use their trunks to help them find food and water. Because their noses are so large, elephants have a keen sense of smell. They can smell water or fruit that is miles away. An elephant can suck up two gallons of water with its trunk. The elephant can squirt the water into its mouth if it\u2019s thirsty. It can squirt the water onto its back to cool down. The trunk wraps around branches and leaves. Then the elephant breaks off the food to put in its mouth. An elephant needs to eat about 300 pounds of grass, leaves, and fruit a day. So its trunk is very busy. Elephants also use their trunks to show feelings. When two elephants meet, they may wrap their trunks in a \u201ctrunk-shake.\u201d Mother elephants pat their babies with their trunks. And baby elephants suck their own trunks for comfort.",
