        "sentence": "We know a lot about chimpanzees because of Jane Goodall. She studied the apes for over 30 years. She crawled through thick forests in Africa to sit still and watch them. During that time, Jane wrote down what she saw and heard. We now know that chimpanzees live in friendly groups. They greet each other with a hug and a kiss. Mother chimps tickle their babies and make them laugh. Chimpanzees play games together, and they clean each other. They show their feelings, too. Worried chimpanzees pucker their lips. Scared chimpanzees bare their teeth. Calm and happy chimpanzees smile. And each sound a chimpanzee makes means something. For example, chimpanzees bark when they find food. Chimpanzees also solve problems. They use sticks as tools to get food they cannot reach. They chew leaves and use them as sponges to sop up water.",
