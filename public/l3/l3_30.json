        "sentence": "Wrinkly gray skin, a huge body, a seven-foot nose. Elephants all seem to look the same. But there are two different kinds of elephants\u2014African and Asian. Each kind is named for the place where it lives in the wild. If you learn a few things to look for, you can tell whether an elephant is African or Asian. An easy way to tell African and Asian elephants apart is to first look at an elephant\u2019s ears. An African elephant has large ears that flap like wings. An Asian elephant has much smaller, rounded ears. Next, look at the elephant\u2019s head. The top of an African elephant\u2019s head is rounded. But an Asian elephant\u2019s head has two bumps on it. If the elephant does not have tusks, it is a female Asian. Finally, check out the elephant\u2019s body. If the back dips down in the middle, it is an African elephant. The back of an Asian elephant is humped. If the two kinds of elephants stood side by side, the African elephant would be much larger.",
