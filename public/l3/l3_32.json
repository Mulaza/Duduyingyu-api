        "sentence": "As a child, Diego Rivera drew everywhere. He drew on furniture, on walls, and across floors, too. So Diego\u2019s parents covered the walls of his room with sheets of paper. When he grew up, Diego became a famous muralist (MYOO-Ruhl-ist). A muralist is an artist who creates large drawings on walls. Diego was born in Mexico. Some of his greatest murals are in Mexico City at the Office of Education. The building is two blocks long and one block wide. The walls are three stories high! Diego painted all the walls that faced the courtyard. He created 124 scenes about life in Mexico. Diego\u2019s helpers began the project. They spread a paste called plaster on the walls. Then Diego painted the plaster. He used special paints that were made every day. Helpers made big buckets of the paint. Diego worked for five years painting all of the walls. He spent much of that time on ladders. He liked making art that was outdoors, where everyone could enjoy it.",
