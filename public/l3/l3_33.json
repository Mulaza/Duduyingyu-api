        "sentence": "The class sat quietly. Some students stared out the windows and others doodled. Everyone was waiting for Max. He stood over his backpack, which was slumped on his desk. Max tugged at the zipper, which refused to budge at first. After a few more tries, Max unzipped his backpack. It was stuffed with things. \u201cI know I put it in here last night,\u201d Max mumbled. Max\u2019s teacher walked over to his desk and folded her arms. Her foot began a steady tap. Max did not want to keep his teacher waiting. He reached into his backpack and quickly pulled out its contents. Out came gum wrappers and cookie crumbs. Out came rubber bands and markers. Out came some action figures and a broken pencil. Max finally got to the bottom of the backpack. A sheet of paper wrinkled as he grabbed it. \u201cI knew I would find it!\u201d said Max. He sounded as if he had won a race.",
