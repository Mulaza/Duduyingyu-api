{"lesson": {"type": "sentence", "title": "Diving Deep, Deep, Deep", "sentence": "Dr. Sylvia Earle is a scientist who studies the ocean. She studies fish and plants that live in the sea. Dr. Earle has discovered new sea life and has created underwater vehicles. She won a \u201cHero of the Planet\u201d award for her efforts to protect the oceans. Dr. Earle actually lived underwater for two weeks. She lived in a small lab on the ocean floor. The lab had four rooms in which the scientists ate and slept. Dr. Earle set two deep-diving records. First, she made the deepest underwater walk. She wore a very heavy suit that was something like a spacesuit. The suit had a long cord that reached up to a boat. She wore a helmet that had four round windows in it so she could look forward, up, and out both sides. A few years later, Dr. Earle made a dive in a special vehicle made for deep dives. She broke the record for the deepest dive by a woman.", "key_words": [{"word": "word", "translation": "--", "speech": "\u540d\u8bcd", "example": "N/A"}, {"word": "word", "translation": "--", "speech": "\u540d\u8bcd", "example": "N/A"}]}, "test": [{"type": "scq", "sentence": "Which of these best describes who the passage is about", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "A woman who won awards", "value": "A woman who won awards"}, {"text_en": "An underwater scientist", "value": "An underwater scientist"}, {"text_en": "A woman who likes to dive", "value": "A woman who likes to dive"}, {"text_en": "A person who studies animals", "value": "A person who studies animals"}]}, {"type": "scq", "sentence": "The setting of most of the passage is ", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "A lab under the sea", "value": "A lab under the sea"}, {"text_en": "A diving suit", "value": "A diving suit"}, {"text_en": "The deep sea", "value": "The deep sea"}, {"text_en": "Outer space", "value": "Outer space"}]}, {"type": "scq", "sentence": "Based on what you read, what is true about dr. sylvia earle", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "She is helpless", "value": "She is helpless"}, {"text_en": "She is calm", "value": "She is calm"}, {"text_en": "She is curious", "value": "She is curious"}, {"text_en": "She is weak.", "value": "She is weak."}]}, {"type": "scq", "sentence": "Dr. earles helmet had four windows so that she ", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "Could see as many stars as possible", "value": "Could see as many stars as possible"}, {"text_en": "Would not get lost in the ocean", "value": "Would not get lost in the ocean"}, {"text_en": "Could make the deepest dive ever", "value": "Could make the deepest dive ever"}, {"text_en": "Could see all around her", "value": "Could see all around her"}]}]}
