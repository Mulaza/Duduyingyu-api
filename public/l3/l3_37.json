They galloped around the yard like horses to see who was fastest. The girls made a craft, too. Carrie\u2019s mom brought out some real horseshoes. They were spray painted in bright colors. Each girl decorated a horseshoe with puffy paint and glitter. After that, the girls were ready for cake. Carrie\u2019s cake was shaped like a horse with its front legs raised. Carrie\u2019s friends sang and then yelled, \u201cMake a wish!\u201d Carrie knew exactly what to wish for. She closed her eyes and thought about nothing but her wish. Then Carrie took a deep breath and blew out all nine candles. Poof! A pony appeared at Carrie\u2019s side. The pony inspected Carrie from head to toe. Then it flicked its tail and neighed. \u201cI like your shoes, Carrie,\u201d it said. \u201cWhere can I get shoes that sparkle?\u201d",
