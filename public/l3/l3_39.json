        "sentence": "Some birds are friends of crocodiles. Other birds stay with hippos. One kind of bird visits badgers. These animals are partners. They help each other survive. Crocodiles welcome small plover birds as guests. A croc opens its large jaw and the bird hops in. The plover nibbles the leftover food and the small animals stuck between the crocodile\u2019s teeth. As a result, the croc\u2019s teeth stay healthy, and the plover gets a meal. It\u2019s not unusual to see an egret riding on a hippo\u2019s hide. Ticks and flies swarm around hippos. The bird doesn\u2019t have to move to get its food. The hippo gets rid of pests, and the egret gets to eat. Some say that the honeyguide bird works with the honey badger. The bird flies to find a hive. It makes a racket when a hive is found. The badger hurries over and gets its fill of honey. The bird swoops down for the leftovers.",
