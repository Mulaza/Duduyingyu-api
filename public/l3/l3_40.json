Then he begins making the base of his tower. Rey lays three bricks side by side. Then he places some flat rocks on top. Rey stacks more bricks on top of the rocks. The base is nice and strong. Rey then spreads some grass on the flat rocks. Then he finds some twigs. He puts them in one layer. Rey sets more flat rocks on the twigs to keep them in place. The twigs look good poking out of the rocks. Then he finds some toy cars and lines them up on the rocks. The tower is getting tall. Rey feels it\u2019s time to add some wood. He stacks three boards, then two bumpy rocks, and then three more boards. Rey saves the biggest and heaviest board for the top.", "key_words": [{"word": "word", "translation": "--", "speech": "\u540d\u8bcd", "example": "N/A"}, {"word": "word", "translation": "--", "speech": "\u540d\u8bcd", "example": "N/A"}]}, "test": [{"type": "scq", "sentence": "What will probably happen next", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "The tower will stand", "value": "The tower will stand"}, {"text_en": "Rey will sit on the tower", "value": "Rey will sit on the tower"}, {"text_en": "Rey will keep adding heavy wood", "value": "Rey will keep adding heavy wood"}, {"text_en": "The tower will fall.", "value": "The tower will fall."}]}, {"type": "scq", "sentence": "What will rey probably do the next time he builds a tower", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "Set pine cones on top of the flat rocks", "value": "Set pine cones on top of the flat rocks"}, {"text_en": "Make a base on bumpy grass", "value": "Make a base on bumpy grass"}, {"text_en": "Place the heaviest board on the bottom", "value": "Place the heaviest board on the bottom"}, {"text_en": "Place the heaviest board on the top", "value": "Place the heaviest board on the top"}]}, {"type": "scq", "sentence": "Why did the author write the story", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "To talk the reader into building a tower", "value": "To talk the reader into building a tower"}, {"text_en": "For the reader to enjoy", "value": "For the reader to enjoy"}, {"text_en": "To argue why kids should not build towers", "value": "To argue why kids should not build towers"}, {"text_en": "To tell the reader how to make a tower", "value": "To tell the reader how to make a tower"}]}, {"type": "scq", "sentence": "What is the story mainly about", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "A strong tower of wood and bricks", "value": "A strong tower of wood and bricks"}, {"text_en": "Things that are found in a yard", "value": "Things that are found in a yard"}, {"text_en": "A boy making a tower", "value": "A boy making a tower"}, {"text_en": "The way to build a tower", "value": "The way to build a tower"}]}]}
