        "sentence": "Connor is always the last one to say good night to his little sister. After Mom kisses Katy, Connor chases away the bedroom monsters. He dances around the room and waves an imaginary wand. Connor shouts, \u201cAlakazee! Alakazam! All you monsters flee to Amsterdam!\u201d Then he tickles Katy\u2019s feet and tucks her in. Katy giggles as she says good night. At breakfast, Connor pours cereal for Katy. When she spills her juice, Connor refills her cup. He tells her to eat all of her banana because it has lots of vitamins. After they eat, Connor helps Katy wash her hands. They brush their teeth together. \u201cLet\u2019s pretend our brushes are trains,\u201d says Connor. \u201cThey\u2019re chugging down teeth tracks.\u201d Katy puts on her coat all by herself when it is time to play. She and Connor storm out the door. \u201cPlay ball!\u201d Katy begs. She points to a big, soft ball in the yard.",
