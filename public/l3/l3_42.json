        "sentence": "You fall hard and cut your knee. Blood oozes from the broken skin. Before you can say \u201cOuch!\u201d blood cells take action. Two important things happen. Blood cells called platelets (PLAYT-lets) travel to the cut. The platelets stick together and help form a clot. The clot works like a bandage. It keeps more blood from flowing out. At the same time, white blood cells travel to the wound. They attack any germs that entered your body through the broken skin. The bleeding stops, but your body continues to work. It makes new skin cells to repair the cut skin. The clot begins to dry and harden. A crusty, dark-red or brown scab forms. The scab allows the skin underneath to grow and heal. The scab also keeps germs from entering the wound. A scab falls off when the healing is complete. There\u2019s a fresh new layer of skin where the cut had been.",
