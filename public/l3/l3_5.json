        "sentence": "Waxwings are small songbirds. They have pale yellow bellies and yellow tips on their tail feathers. Some young waxwings are odd because they look different from their parents. Those young birds have tail feathers with orange tips. Scientists have discovered why. The answer has to do with food. Waxwings mostly eat berries. One kind of honeysuckle plant grows in some places. The plant\u2019s berries grow for just a short time. The berries have a strong red color. Some waxwings feed a lot of those red berries to their babies. Their babies might be growing tail feathers at that time. If they are, the red color settles in their tail feathers. Instead of having yellow tips like their parents, their feathers are tipped in orange.",
