A dog shows when it is happy to see you. It looks at you and wags its tail, or it runs around quickly in circles. Some happy dogs will jump up on you. A scared dog acts differently than a happy dog. A frightened dog puts its tail down between its legs. Some scared dogs growl. Others try to hide. Dogs like being with people, so they try to get your attention. They tap you with a paw or place their head in your lap. They also might look at you and bark or howl. Dogs show when they want to be left alone, too. A dog that is upset will bare its teeth, or it will growl. Both are signs to stay away!", "key_words": [{"word": "word", "translation": "--", "speech": "\u540d\u8bcd", "example": "N/A"}, {"word": "word", "translation": "--", "speech": "\u540d\u8bcd", "example": "N/A"}]}, "test": [{"type": "scq", "sentence": "What is the passage mainly about", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "The ways dogs use their voices to talk", "value": "The ways dogs use their voices to talk"}, {"text_en": "The ways dogs tell people what they want", "value": "The ways dogs tell people what they want"}, {"text_en": "How dogs show they are scared", "value": "How dogs show they are scared"}, {"text_en": "Why dogs run in circles", "value": "Why dogs run in circles"}]}, {"type": "scq", "sentence": "Based on the passage, which sentence is true", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "Happy dogs may jump up on you", "value": "Happy dogs may jump up on you"}, {"text_en": "Sad dogs cry tears", "value": "Sad dogs cry tears"}, {"text_en": "Scared dogs run in circles", "value": "Scared dogs run in circles"}, {"text_en": "Upset dogs want a lot to eat.", "value": "Upset dogs want a lot to eat."}]}, {"type": "scq", "sentence": "What might cause a dog to put its head in your lap", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "It is scared of some noise", "value": "It is scared of some noise"}, {"text_en": "It is happy that you are home", "value": "It is happy that you are home"}, {"text_en": "It wants you to pay attention to it", "value": "It wants you to pay attention to it"}, {"text_en": "Its stomach is upset.", "value": "Its stomach is upset."}]}, {"type": "scq", "sentence": "A happy dog wags its tail, but a scared dog ", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "Taps you with a paw", "value": "Taps you with a paw"}, {"text_en": "Puts its tail down", "value": "Puts its tail down"}, {"text_en": "Lifts its tail", "value": "Lifts its tail"}, {"text_en": "Looks at you and howl", "value": "Looks at you and howl"}]}]}
