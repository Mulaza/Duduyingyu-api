        "sentence": "Fabio was new at summer camp, and he did not like it at all. In fact, he hated every minute of it. On his first day, he and the other campers swam in a lake. The bottom of the lake felt like muddy slime creeping between Fabio\u2019s toes. He dashed out of the water when a fish nibbled at his knee. Fabio\u2019s second day started badly. The campers hiked through some woods. Dry twigs scratched Fabio\u2019s legs, and black bugs bit his arms. The stinky smell of a skunk made his eyes water. Fabio walked behind the others. He wished he were at home. Then a boy named Cody started talking to Fabio. It turned out that they liked playing the same games. They made a deal to try out for the camp softball team. Fabio thought the next day at camp would be fun.",
