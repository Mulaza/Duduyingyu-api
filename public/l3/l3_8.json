        "sentence": "Penguins and puffins are two kinds of seabirds. They both are black and white. And they both have webbed feet. However, puffins are much smaller than penguins. Puffins are more colorful, too. Puffins have bright orange beaks, legs, and feet. Penguins have black beaks, and their feet are often black, too. You won\u2019t find puffins and penguins living together. Penguins live far south and puffins live far north. But they both depend on the sea for their food. Both birds have sharp spikes in their mouths. The spikes hold on to the fish they catch. Although penguins and puffins are birds, penguins cannot fly. Their wings are too stiff. Penguins\u2019 wings, however, work as flippers. They allow penguins to dive deep into the sea. Puffins use their wings for flying and for diving. But they cannot dive as deep as penguins.",
