The kids are part of the Puffin Patrol. The kids live on an island off the coast of Iceland. In the spring, puffins roost on the island\u2019s cliffs. Each female lays one egg. By the middle of August, the baby seabirds are ready to leave their nests. They know to head toward the ocean. Lights from the night sky reflect on the sea. Most of the birds go toward those lights. But some babies fly toward the lights of the town. They crash-land in yards, parking lots, and streets. Cats, dogs, and cars might harm the baby birds. So kids gather them up. In the morning, they carry their boxes of puffins to the sea. The kids toss the birds high into the air. The young seabirds glide on the wind and then land on the water. They are safe at home.",
