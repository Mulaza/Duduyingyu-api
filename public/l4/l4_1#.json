        "sentence": "The Arctic Ocean is the smallest and coldest ocean in the world. It stretches from the North Pole to Asia, Europe, and North America. The Arctic Ocean is mostly covered in sea ice all year. It is home to penguins, walruses, polar bears, and whales. Because the ocean is so cold, few plants and animals can live there. The Arctic Ocean covers 5.4 million square miles. It is smaller than all other oceans. It is also the shallowest ocean. The temperature of the Arctic Ocean stays around 32 degrees Fahrenheit (zero degrees Celsius). The large amount of sea ice in the ocean stops its temperature from changing too much. However, much of the ice in the Arctic Ocean is melting because of global warming.",
