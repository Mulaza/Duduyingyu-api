        "sentence": "If you wanted to save one thing for the future, what would you pick? For Dr. Cary Fowler, it\u2019s an easy choice. He would save seeds. Dr. Fowler is the scientist who helped create the Svalbard Global Seed Vault in Norway, near the Arctic. Dr. Fowler is trying to collect and save seeds from every food crop in the world. Why would anyone save seeds? Well, Dr. Fowler believes the world must be prepared in case something terrible happens. Some disasters, whether they are natural or caused by people, could destroy crops around the world. People wouldn\u2019t have food, and they might not be able to grow it. Dr. Fowler believes we must protect seeds today so we can grow crops in the future. Today the seed vault has over 400,000 different types of seeds. Dr. Fowler hopes to one day have over 1 million types of seeds. He is asking countries around the world to deposit seeds into the vault so that the seeds can be withdrawn when we need them.",
