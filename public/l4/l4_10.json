{"lesson": {"type": "sentence", "title": "One Smelly Bug", "sentence": "Bombardier (bom-buhr-DEER) beetles are colorful but are best left alone. These beetles get their name from the way they keep themselves safe. When a bombardier beetle is threatened, it \u201cbombards\u201d its enemy by spraying a boiling hot, smelly liquid from its body. Frogs, birds, and other animals looking for a meal get a nasty surprise instead. The bombardier beetle has special body parts that hold two liquids. Muscles push these liquids together, where they mix into a smelly, hot spray. The beetle can aim the liquid in many directions. This allows it to protect itself from the front, side, or back. When the beetle sprays, it also makes a loud pop and a gas that looks like smoke. It\u2019s quite a surprise to see a popping, smoking bug! The beetle isn\u2019t the only animal that can protect itself by stinking. Skunks, stink bugs, and musk ox are a few other animals that also use a nasty smell to keep others away. But they don\u2019t pop and smoke like the bombardier beetle does. So watch out for this \u201cexplosive\u201d insect!", "key_words": [{"word": "word", "translation": "--", "speech": "\u540d\u8bcd", "example": "N/A"}, {"word": "word", "translation": "--", "speech": "\u540d\u8bcd", "example": "N/A"}]}, "test": [{"type": "scq", "sentence": " whatisthe passage mostly about", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "How the bombardier beetle got its name", "value": "How the bombardier beetle got its name"}, {"text_en": "Animals that stink", "value": "Animals that stink"}, {"text_en": "The difference between liquids and gases", "value": "The difference between liquids and gases"}, {"text_en": "A beetle that defends itself in a special way ", "value": "A beetle that defends itself in a special way "}]}, {"type": "scq", "sentence": " accordingtothepassage,howareskunks andbombardierbeetlesalike", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "Both are hunted by frogs", "value": "Both are hunted by frogs"}, {"text_en": "Both use a bad smell to protect themselves", "value": "Both use a bad smell to protect themselves"}, {"text_en": "Both make a loud popping noise", "value": "Both make a loud popping noise"}, {"text_en": "Both make a boiling hot liquid.
