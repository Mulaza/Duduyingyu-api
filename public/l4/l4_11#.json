        "sentence": "Bombardier (bom-buhr-DEER) beetles are colorful but are best left alone. These beetles get their name from the way they keep themselves safe. When a bombardier beetle is threatened, it “bombards” its enemy by spraying a boiling hot, smelly liquid from its body. Frogs, birds, and other animals looking for a meal get a nasty surprise instead. The bombardier beetle has special body parts that hold two liquids. Muscles push these liquids together, where they mix into a smelly, hot spray. The beetle can aim the liquid in many directions. This allows it to protect itself from the front, side, or back. When the beetle sprays, it also makes a loud pop and a gas that looks like smoke. It’s quite a surprise to see a popping, smoking bug! The beetle isn’t the only animal that can protect itself by stinking. Skunks, stink bugs, and musk ox are a few other animals that also use a nasty smell to keep others away. But they don’t pop and smoke like the bombardier beetle does. So watch out for this “explosive” insect!",
