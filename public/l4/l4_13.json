        "sentence": "Tammy was in a foul mood. Her parents had insisted that she was too young for a cell phone, no matter how much she begged. \u201cBut Sun and Alicia have cell phones!\u201d Tammy cried. \u201cIf I don\u2019t get one, I won\u2019t be popular.\u201d \u201cHaving a cell phone doesn\u2019t make you popular,\u201d Tammy\u2019s dad said. He was always saying stuff like that, as if he knew what it was like to be in fourth grade. \u201cBesides,\u201d Dad said, \u201cyour school doesn\u2019t allow cell phones, and you can call your friends from the house as soon as you finish your homework.\u201d \u201cBut I can\u2019t send them text messages,\u201d Tammy replied. \u201cYou can use e-mail,\u201d Mom said. \u201cCell phones are expensive. We want you to wait until you can pay for part of the cost before you get one.\u201d \u201cBy that time I won\u2019t need one,\u201d Tammy said. \u201cNobody will know who I am. I might as well move to a deserted island.\u201d \u201cIn that case, I\u2019ll get you some empty bottles and some paper,\u201d Dad said. \u201cBottle messages are way cooler than text messages.\u201d \u201cUgh,\u201d sighed Tammy.",
