        "sentence": "Tammy was in a foul mood. Her parents had insisted that she was too young for a cell phone, no matter how much she begged. “But Sun and Alicia have cell phones!” Tammy cried. “If I don’t get one, I won’t be popular.” “Having a cell phone doesn’t make you popular,” Tammy’s dad said. He was always saying stuff like that, as if he knew what it was like to be in fourth grade. “Besides,” Dad said, “your school doesn’t allow cell phones, and you can call your friends from the house as soon as you finish your homework.” “But I can’t send them text messages,” Tammy replied. “You can use e-mail,” Mom said. “Cell phones are expensive. We want you to wait until you can pay for part of the cost before you get one.” “By that time I won’t need one,” Tammy said. “Nobody will know who I am. I might as well move to a deserted island.” “In that case, I’ll get you some empty bottles and some paper,” Dad said. “Bottle messages are way cooler than text messages.” “Ugh,” sighed Tammy.",
