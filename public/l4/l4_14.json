        "sentence": "A neighborhood party is a great way to raise money for a charity, to celebrate a holiday, or to get to know the people in your neighborhood. There\u2019s no better way to bring the community together than to throw a party! Before you begin, you first need to figure out where to have the party. Churches or community centers are often available for neighborhood events. If the weather is nice, many people prefer to have the party outside. It could be at a park or on a street that has been blocked off for you ahead of time. Next, ask your friends and neighbors to help. Volunteers are important for making sure the party runs smoothly. Get plenty of people to help tell others about the party, set up the party, and clean up after the party. A volunteer can post fliers or pass out cards to people in the neighborhood. During the party, be sure to have lots of things to do. Many parties feature activities for kids, such as relay races or face painting. At most parties, food and drinks are served. The best parties are when everyone brings something to share. After all, that\u2019s what being part of a neighborhood is about!",
