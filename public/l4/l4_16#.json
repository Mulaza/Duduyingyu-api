        "sentence": "It’s not hard to see why cheeseburgers, fries, pizza, and ice cream are popular. They’re delicious! But not everything that tastes good is good for you. The next time you need to feed, consider smart snacks. Nearly everyone loves french fries made from potatoes. Did you know that other root vegetables taste great, too? Root vegetables include beets, carrots, and sweet potatoes. They contain important vitamins and minerals, and they can all do the jobs a potato can do. Raw carrots are crunchy and satisfying. Cooked beets and sweet potatoes are full of flavor. Peel them and cut them into strips, just like fries. Raw carrots are crunchy, and when beets and sweet potatoes are cooked, they are sweet. Give them a try! You’ll forget all about french fries. Discovering new foods can be fun. Plus, if you eat healthful foods, you’ll be less likely to get sick. You’ll also have more energy to run and play. And you will be able to think more clearly and for longer periods of time. So start snacking smartly!",
