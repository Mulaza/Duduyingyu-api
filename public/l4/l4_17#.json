        "sentence": "Have you ever noticed small “rivers” of water running down the sides of streets after a heavy rain? That’s storm water, and it is a big source of water pollution. In cities, the roads and sidewalks cover much of the ground. Therefore, they block the ground from soaking up water. As a result, storm water collects on the pavement or flows through gutters. Most cities have storm drains that channel the storm water out of the city. This keeps cities from flooding, but it has an unwanted effect. It dumps a lot of dirty water into lakes, rivers, and the ocean. So how does storm water pollute? Well, if you have ever walked down the sidewalk, you have probably noticed trash in the street. Storm water carries this trash with it as it flows. As a result, bags, cans, and bottles end up in lakes and rivers. So do oil and gasoline left behind by cars. This is because when rain hits the streets, it picks up trash and waste from cars and washes it into the storm water. Scientists and people who plan how cities are designed want to find a way to stop storm water from being such a hazard. They think planning better, having trees and grassy areas, and teaching people not to litter will help.",
