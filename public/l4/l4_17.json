        "sentence": "Roy Chapman Andrews was an American explorer born in 1884. He liked traveling to different places and studying animals. Andrews wanted to find fossils that would tell him more about early humans. Instead, he found something that changed what everyone thought about dinosaurs. Andrews and his team made many trips to Asia during the 1920s. There, they found dinosaur fossils, as well as fossils from different mammals, including a type of early rhinoceros. Andrews sent his discoveries to the American Museum of Natural History in New York. They liked what he found and encouraged him to keep searching. Andrews’ most interesting discovery was made in 1923 in the Gobi Desert of Mongolia. He and his team became the first people to find dinosaur eggs. Until this discovery, scientists weren’t sure whether dinosaurs laid eggs or gave birth to live babies. In 1927, the Boy Scouts of America made Andrews an honorary Scout. He was the first person to receive this award. Today, Andrews is regarded as a model explorer and adventurer.",
