        "sentence": "When my sister Gina was born, she had a problem with her heart. She had five operations before she was three years old. She had trouble walking, playing with other children, and going to school. Our parents wanted to take Gina to a special place in Florida where she could swim with dolphins. Gina was scared because she had never been around dolphins before. We had also never traveled that far as a family. When we got to Florida, we saw where the dolphins lived. It was a place where kids with special needs like Gina could come and spend time. I thought it was going to be a vacation, but it wasn’t. Gina had to work hard every day for a week. The trip was amazing. Gina laughed and clapped when she saw the dolphin, and the dolphin squeaked and splashed when it saw Gina. They swam together all day. Gina was able to move her body more than she normally did at home. Mom and Dad were proud of Gina. I was, too.",
