        "sentence": "My house gets energy from the sun. That kind of energy is called \u201csolar power.\u201d We use it to power the lights, the television, and the computer. It also powers the stove and toaster. It even runs the heater in the winter and the air conditioner in the summer. We collect the sun\u2019s energy with large solar panels on our roof. These panels turn the sun\u2019s energy into electricity. Some of the electricity gets used right away, and some of it is stored so we can use it at night. In the winter, getting enough sunlight can be hard. So sometimes we have to use electricity from the power company. But we need less of this electricity than we would without our solar panels. The sun is a good source of energy because it will never run out. It is also cleaner than some other kinds of energy and is becoming less expensive, too. In the future, more people will have panels like ours on their roofs.",
