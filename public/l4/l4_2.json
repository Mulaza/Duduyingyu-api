This festival celebrates the happiness of children and mothers across the country. It is a national holiday for everyone in Japan. Children\u2019s Day probably began as a festival for boys around ad 600. People flew flags shaped like a fish called a carp. The carp is a symbol of strength and health. Each boy had his own flag, and the oldest boy had the biggest flag. People still fly carp flags today. But in 1948, the Japanese government changed the festival so that it celebrated both boys and girls. People in Japan do many things on Children\u2019s Day. They eat special treats, such as rice cakes wrapped in oak leaves. They also take hot baths in water that has the leaves of iris plants in it. These leaves are said to be good for a person\u2019s health. But the children in Tokyo, the capital of Japan, get something extra special. They compete in the Kids\u2019 Olympics on Children\u2019s Day. There is a torch relay and races for kids and their parents. So before you\u2019re too old, plan a trip to Japan to celebrate Children\u2019s Day, and have fun being a kid!", "key_words": [{"word": "word", "translation": "--", "speech": "\u540d\u8bcd", "example": "N/A"}, {"word": "word", "translation": "--", "speech": "\u540d\u8bcd", "example": "N/A"}]}, "test": [{"type": "scq", "sentence": " whatisthe passage mostly about", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "Flags in japan", "value": "Flags in japan"}, {"text_en": "Changes in japanese holidays", "value": "Changes in japanese holidays"}, {"text_en": "A festival celebrating children", "value": "A festival celebrating children"}, {"text_en": "Food and drinks made from rice ", "value": "Food and drinks made from rice "}]}, {"type": "scq", "sentence": " what do people in japan not do onchildrens day", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "Wrap rice cakes in iris leaves", "value": "Wrap rice cakes in iris leaves"}, {"text_en": "Fly carp flags", "value": "Fly carp flags"}, {"text_en": "Eat special treats", "value": "Eat special treats"}, {"text_en": "Take baths with iris leaves ", "value": "Take baths with iris leaves "}]}, {"type": "scq", "sentence": " according to the passage, what changed about childrens day in 1948", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "Boys could celebrate, but girls could not", "value": "Boys could celebrate, but girls could not"}, {"text_en": "It became a national holiday", "value": "It became a national holiday"}, {"text_en": "It celebrated girls as well as boys", "value": "It celebrated girls as well as boys"}, {"text_en": "People began using carp flags.
