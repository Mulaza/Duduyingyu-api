But his two neighbors, Ms. Abrams and Mr. Green, were the noisiest people he had ever known! In the house on the left, Ms. Abrams gave tuba lessons. In the house on the right, Mr. Green worked on cuckoo clocks. And in the middle was Mr. Kim\u2014sad, tired, and crabby. Then he had an idea. He would pay his neighbors to move! \u201cOh boy!\u201d Ms. Abrams said when Mr. Kim offered her $200 to move away. \u201cHot dog!\u201d said Mr. Green when Mr. Kim offered him the same deal. The next day, he saw Mr. Green carrying his clocks to Ms. Abrams\u2019 house and Ms. Abrams carrying her tuba to Mr. Green\u2019s house. \u201cI thought you were both moving,\u201d Mr. Kim said. \u201cWe are,\u201d Mr. Green said. \u201cMs. Abrams is moving into my old place, and I\u2019m moving into hers.\u201d Mr. Kim nearly fainted. What would he do? The next day, Mr. Green and Ms. Abrams visited Mr. Kim. \u201cWe know why you asked us to move,\u201d Mr. Green said. \u201cSo we got you this.\u201d And they gave Mr. Kim a very fancy set of earmuffs.
