        "sentence": "My cousin Chris plays rugby. He says it\u2019s similar to football and soccer, but some things are different. A rugby field is called a \u201cpitch.\u201d However, Chris\u2019s rugby team plays on the soccer field since it\u2019s the same size as a pitch. To score points, players kick, carry, or throw the ball down the pitch. A rugby \u201cgoal\u201d is like a football touchdown, and it is worth five points. A rugby \u201cdrop goal\u201d is like a football field goal. For both drop goals and field goals, you kick the ball between two posts to score three points. The pitch is crowded during a rugby game. That\u2019s because each team has 15 players on the field at once. That is more players than in football and soccer, both of which have 11 players. The ball that players use in rugby is similar to a football. It is made from leather and is shaped like an oval. But it doesn\u2019t have laces, and the ends are less pointed than a football\u2019s ends. Chris enjoys playing rugby and hopes to join a league soon. I might join, too.",
