{"lesson": {"type": "sentence", "title": "Slow Down, Bo!", "sentence": "Bo is a husky that was born in Alaska, but he lives with us in Minnesota now. I walk Bo in the morning and afternoon. During every walk, I usually end up shouting, \u201cSlow down, Bo!\u201d When Bo was in Alaska, he liked to pull sleds and run fast. He worked with a team of other dogs to pull a sled over snow and ice. Bo was very fast and strong, and his team won several dog-sled races. Many people enjoyed rooting for Bo to run. Whenever we go on walks, Bo starts out running. He jerks me down the sidewalk and pulls me around the park. I have to dig my heels into the ground and pull Bo back with a sharp tug. This is the only way Bo will stop. I have to wait for him to calm down before we start walking again. Some people think it is funny when they see Bo trying to race instead of walk with me. \u201cGo, Bo! Go!\u201d they shout and laugh. \u201cNo, Bo! Oh please, no!\u201d I yell. I don\u2019t think it is very funny because it feels like Bo is likely to pull my arms off. Mom says Bo will eventually learn how to walk slowly and not try to run everywhere. I hope he\u2019s a fast learner.", "key_words": [{"word": "word", "translation": "--", "speech": "\u540d\u8bcd", "example": "N/A"}, {"word": "word", "translation": "--", "speech": "\u540d\u8bcd", "example": "N/A"}]}, "test": [{"type": "scq", "sentence": " what is the theme of the passage", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "Not all dogs make good pets", "value": "Not all dogs make good pets"}, {"text_en": "Learning something new takes time", "value": "Learning something new takes time"}, {"text_en": "Being strict is better than having fun", "value": "Being strict is better than having fun"}, {"text_en": "Having pets is a large responsibility.
