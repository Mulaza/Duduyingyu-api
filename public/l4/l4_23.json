{"lesson": {"type": "sentence", "title": "Life On Jupiter\u2019S Icy Moon", "sentence": "Jupiter is the largest planet in our solar system and is made up of many different kinds of gases. It is so big that 1,300 Earths could fit inside Jupiter! And it has 63 moons. Some of its moons are like small planets, and others are pieces of frozen rock and ice. Studying Jupiter\u2019s moons has helped scientists learn more about the solar system. But the moon that scientists are most interested in is Europa (yur-OH-pa). The conditions on Europa make it the most likely place other than Earth to have life in our solar system. It is covered in a layer of ice, and some scientists believe a liquid ocean lies beneath the icy surface. If this is true, Europa may have simple forms of life in these oceans. The creatures on Europa would probably be too small to see without a microscope. But the idea of anything at all living on Europa is very exciting. Right now, we cannot explore Europa because it is too cold and too far away to send people there. The spacecrafts and robots we have are not sturdy enough to land on the surface. But scientists have big plans. In the future, they hope to send one robot to melt some of the ice on Europa\u2019s surface, and another robot to swim through its oceans. The information that these robots gather could change what we think about life beyond Earth.", "key_words": [{"word": "word", "translation": "--", "speech": "\u540d\u8bcd", "example": "N/A"}, {"word": "word", "translation": "--", "speech": "\u540d\u8bcd", "example": "N/A"}]}, "test": [{"type": "scq", "sentence": " whatisthe passage mostly about", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "Jupiters many moons", "value": "Jupiters many moons"}, {"text_en": "Life on europa", "value": "Life on europa"}, {"text_en": "Scientists search for new life", "value": "Scientists search for new life"}, {"text_en": "The problem with exploring outer space ", "value": "The problem with exploring outer space "}]}, {"type": "scq", "sentence": " europaisbest described as ", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "Warm and full of life", "value": "Warm and full of life"}, {"text_en": "Cold and uninteresting", "value": "Cold and uninteresting"}, {"text_en": "Icy and mysterious", "value": "Icy and mysterious"}, {"text_en": "Cool and dry ", "value": "Cool and dry "}]}, {"type": "scq", "sentence": " whatisthe main idea of the last paragraph", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "Exploring europa is very difficult", "value": "Exploring europa is very difficult"}, {"text_en": "People are better than robots", "value": "People are better than robots"}, {"text_en": "Scientists want to discover new life", "value": "Scientists want to discover new life"}, {"text_en": "Life can only be discovered by machines.
