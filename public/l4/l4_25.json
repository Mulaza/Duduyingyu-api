        "sentence": "Adults may tell you that it\u2019s tough being a parent. Just tell them that they have it easy compared to the emperor penguin. This parent has one of the toughest jobs in the world. Emperor penguins mate in Antarctica in March or April. The female lays an egg in May or June. Then the mother penguin carefully passes the egg to the father, who balances it on top of his feet. The penguins must be very careful not to drop the egg, as it can crack or freeze if it touches the ground. The mother leaves to find food, and the father waits patiently for the egg to hatch. This usually takes at least 60 days. During that time, the father doesn\u2019t eat, and he must stay very still so he doesn\u2019t hurt the egg. By the time the chick hatches, the father is very weak. But he must feed the baby if the mother has not yet returned. He does this by making a special liquid in his throat. Luckily the mother penguin usually returns within a few days after the chick hatches. She feeds the chick and takes care of it so the father can go get food for himself. By this time, the male has gone 115 days without eating. Talk about a devoted dad!",
