        "sentence": "When people talk about the seasons, they usually mean winter, spring, summer, and fall. But did you know there is also a hurricane season? For people living in the United States, hurricane season starts in June and ends in late November. Although hurricanes and tropical storms can happen at other times, most storms form during the summer and fall months. In early summer, warm temperatures cause the oceans to warm up, especially near the equator. As water from the ocean evaporates, it carries a lot of heat into the atmosphere. This usually creates a storm. Sometimes storms will blow away, but some storms start spinning. They spin faster and faster and become hurricanes. The winds of a hurricane can grow to be as strong as 200 miles per hour. And as the hurricane grows, it begins to travel north. The hurricane moves heat away from the warm part of the ocean in the south into parts of the ocean in the north. As the hurricane does this, it cools and becomes weaker. Eventually, it disappears. By November, ocean and air temperatures are too cool for hurricanes to form. But by June, hurricane season is sure to start all over again.",
