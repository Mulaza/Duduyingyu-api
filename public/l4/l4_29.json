        "sentence": "Megan could hardly stay in her seat as her dad pulled the car into the parking lot of Coaster Kingdom, the biggest roller coaster park in the state. Today was Megan\u2019s 11th birthday and she was sure she was finally tall enough to ride the scariest coaster, the Dragon. The Dragon\u2019s tracks were made from wood, not metal. Megan knew that wooden tracks were slower than metal ones, but wooden tracks also swayed and creaked, especially on windy days like today. Megan\u2019s father paid for their tickets, and she excitedly took his hand. She wanted to hurry to the coaster, but her dad was thirsty after the long car ride. They stopped at the food court and shared a frozen lemonade and a warm, sugary churro. After their snack, Megan led her dad to the entrance of the Dragon. A sign shaped like a friendly dragon stood in front of the gate. The dragon was holding one hand up, and the message read, \u201cYou must be at least this tall to ride this coaster.\u201d Megan beamed and ran up to the sign. She stood on the tips of her toes and thought tall thoughts. Her father, however, was not smiling. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, honey,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s go check out the other rides. There are still plenty of fun things we can do today.\u201d",
