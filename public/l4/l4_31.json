        "sentence": "As a dog lover who will watch anything about dogs, I had high hopes for Dog Academy. The reality TV show follows a group of badly behaved puppies that go to training school. The school is known for being tough on pets and even tougher on their owners. Unfortunately, the show is toughest on the people who watch it! The best part of Dog Academy is a construction worker named Jim and his tiny poodle, Mitzi-Witzi. Jim is over 6 feet tall, has a thick brown beard, and is bald. He squints and scowls and yells at everyone on the show, but as soon as he is with Mitzi-Witzi, he begins to coo and talk like a baby. Watching them play together is really funny. The show would be much better if it focused only on Jim. The worst part of the show is Kalen, who is one of the dog trainers. Kalen is a horrible woman. She is rude to people and says mean things to them about their pets. When Honkers, a brown pug, chewed up one of Kalen\u2019s sneakers, Kalen told Honkers\u2019 owner that she had never met such a dumb, smelly dog. There is no reason to act that way. It\u2019s just cruel! The show itself is very boring. The puppies are cute, but no one besides Jim and Mitzi-Witzi has much personality. If you are looking for something to watch on Thursday nights, there are much better shows than Dog Academy.",
