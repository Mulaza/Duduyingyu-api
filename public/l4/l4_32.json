{"lesson": {"type": "sentence", "title": "Save The Skunks!", "sentence": "When people think about the need to protect animals, how many think of skunks? People dislike skunks for several reasons. Skunks can get into garbage cans. They sometimes carry diseases. And worst of all, of course, they can spray people and pets with a disgusting smelling liquid. But skunks play an important role in their environment. Skunks are great to have around because they eat other pests. For example, a skunk will eat dangerous scorpions and spiders. Having a skunk around is much better than being bothered by those creepy creatures. Another reason to protect skunks is that they eat animals that are already dead. This helps keep forests and neighborhoods clean. It\u2019s also important to remember that skunks are in our neighborhoods because we have come into their habitats. It\u2019s unfair to want the skunks to leave when they were here first! So the next time you catch a whiff of skunk spray, smile and hold your nose. Think about the good work that this peaceful animal is doing to keep your neighborhood clean and safe.", "key_words": [{"word": "word", "translation": "--", "speech": "\u540d\u8bcd", "example": "N/A"}, {"word": "word", "translation": "--", "speech": "\u540d\u8bcd", "example": "N/A"}]}, "test": [{"type": "scq", "sentence": " according to the passage, which of theseis areason why some people dislike skunks", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "Skunks eat spiders", "value": "Skunks eat spiders"}, {"text_en": "Skunks eat dead animals", "value": "Skunks eat dead animals"}, {"text_en": "Skunks sometimes carry diseases", "value": "Skunks sometimes carry diseases"}, {"text_en": "Skunks are better than scorpions.", "value": "Skunks are better than scorpions."}]}, {"type": "scq", "sentence": " which of these does not tell how the author feels about skunks", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "People dislike skunks for several reasons", "value": "People dislike skunks for several reasons"}, {"text_en": "The next time you catch a whiff of skunk spray, smile and hold your nose", "value": "The next time you catch a whiff of skunk spray, smile and hold your nose"}, {"text_en": "Its unfair to want the skunks to leave when they were here first!", "value": "Its unfair to want the skunks to leave when they were here first!"}, {"text_en": "Skunks are great to have around because they eat other pests.
