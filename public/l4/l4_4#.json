        "sentence": "Stories about dragons that breathe fire and fly through the air are just make-believe. But some islands in the Indian Ocean are home to a very real reptile called the Komodo dragon. This giant lizard can grow to be 10 feet long and weigh up to 150 pounds. Komodo dragons don’t have wings, or smoke coming out of their nostrils, but they have strong tails and a very nasty bite. A Komodo dragon has a powerful venom and knife-like teeth. When a Komodo dragon bites an animal, the animal usually goes into shock and dies quickly. Although they can be dangerous, Komodo dragons usually don’t attack people. In fact, in the past 35 years, Komodo dragons have attacked only five people. The Indonesian people who inhabit the same islands as the dragons believe that the lizards are special and should be treated with respect.",
