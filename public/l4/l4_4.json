        "sentence": "The rain continued to pour throughout the gloomy Saturday afternoon. Lauren and Henry were dressed in their dark blue uniforms. Lauren\u2019s uniform had more dirt stains than Henry\u2019s did because she loved stealing bases and sliding into home. She was the best base stealer on the team. Lauren pounded her fist into her glove as she watched the rain fall in steady sheets. Every couple of minutes, she would sigh loudly, which caused the window to fog up. Henry was reading a comic book and eating an apple and some crackers. He kicked off his shoes and grabbed a pillow from the couch. \u201cAren\u2019t you worried?\u201d Lauren asked him. \u201cWhat if it doesn\u2019t stop raining?\u201d \u201cI hope it rains all day,\u201d Henry said. \u201cI\u2019m having a great time, and besides, we can play next week. This is the final issue of Captain Smoke.\u201d The telephone rang. Henry and Lauren nervously looked at each other. Their mother answered it. \u201cHello, Coach Donna,\u201d she said. After a short pause, she said, \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll let them know. We\u2019ll see you next week.\u201d",
