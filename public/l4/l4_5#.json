        "sentence": "The rain continued to pour throughout the gloomy Saturday afternoon. Lauren and Henry were dressed in their dark blue uniforms. Lauren’s uniform had more dirt stains than Henry’s did because she loved stealing bases and sliding into home. She was the best base stealer on the team. Lauren pounded her fist into her glove as she watched the rain fall in steady sheets. Every couple of minutes, she would sigh loudly, which caused the window to fog up. Henry was reading a comic book and eating an apple and some crackers. He kicked off his shoes and grabbed a pillow from the couch. “Aren’t you worried?” Lauren asked him. “What if it doesn’t stop raining?” “I hope it rains all day,” Henry said. “I’m having a great time, and besides, we can play next week. This is the final issue of Captain Smoke.” The telephone rang. Henry and Lauren nervously looked at each other. Their mother answered it. “Hello, Coach Donna,” she said. After a short pause, she said, “Okay, I’ll let them know. We’ll see you next week.”",
