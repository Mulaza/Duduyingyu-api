        "sentence": "When Galileo (GAL-ih-LAY-oh) was a boy in Italy in 1574, he studied science. As he grew older, Galileo became interested in studying the stars. At that time, most people believed the sun moved around Earth. Galileo wanted to prove that Earth moved around the sun. Galileo got his idea after he read a book and learned more about stars. Galileo studied Jupiter with a telescope. The telescope helped Galileo find some of Jupiter’s many moons. He saw that the moons moved around Jupiter. Now he knew that some things in the solar system did not move around Earth! Galileo wanted to tell everyone about his idea, but he had a problem. Some of Italy’s rulers did not like the idea that Earth was not the center of the universe. They called Galileo a troublemaker and threatened to kill him if he did not say that his ideas were wrong. Galileo agreed, and instead of being killed, he spent the rest of his life in prison. However, Galileo was right! Today we know that the planets move around the sun.",
