        "sentence": "Every Saturday morning, people come to work in the community garden. Some people grow their own vegetables. Other people grow flowers. One person even made a goldfish pond! The garden is a busy place, especially on sunny days. A few years ago, the garden didn’t exist. There was just a run-down parking lot in the spot. Most people said it was only good for growing weeds and collecting trash. But the people in the community saw that the space could be used to make a garden. Now the community garden has 50 plots. Each plot is used by a different person or family. Even some of the local stores have a plot. They grow produce that they sell to people in the community. The fruits and vegetables are fresh, tasty, and healthful. Sometimes, special events take place in the garden, such as music concerts or gardening classes. Other times, schools bring students to the garden to learn about plants and insects. The garden offers much more to the community than just a place to dig in the dirt.",
