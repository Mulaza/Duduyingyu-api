        "sentence": "When Kate came back to school after the winter holiday, she told everyone in her class about the snowman she had built. \u201cIt was 15 feet tall. It was so huge that I needed a ladder to put the hat on top of its head,\u201d Kate said. During lunch, Kate told everyone what a great snowboarder she was. \u201cI was going faster than anyone else on the hill,\u201d Kate said. \u201cI think I set a world record.\u201d During recess, Kate explained to everyone how she had built an igloo from the snow. \u201cIt had five rooms,\u201d Kate said. \u201cWe almost moved into the igloo because it was twice as big as our house.\u201d Just then, it began to snow. All the kids cheered as big white flakes drifted down from the sky. Sarah, who had listened to Kate\u2019s stories all day, smiled. She said to Kate, \u201cNow you can make us a giant snowman and an igloo! And we can watch you set a new record on your snowboard!\u201d Kate\u2019s face turned bright red. She quietly went back inside and didn\u2019t say anything else about her winter vacation.",
