        "sentence": "When Kate came back to school after the winter holiday, she told everyone in her class about the snowman she had built. “It was 15 feet tall. It was so huge that I needed a ladder to put the hat on top of its head,” Kate said. During lunch, Kate told everyone what a great snowboarder she was. “I was going faster than anyone else on the hill,” Kate said. “I think I set a world record.” During recess, Kate explained to everyone how she had built an igloo from the snow. “It had five rooms,” Kate said. “We almost moved into the igloo because it was twice as big as our house.” Just then, it began to snow. All the kids cheered as big white flakes drifted down from the sky. Sarah, who had listened to Kate’s stories all day, smiled. She said to Kate, “Now you can make us a giant snowman and an igloo! And we can watch you set a new record on your snowboard!” Kate’s face turned bright red. She quietly went back inside and didn’t say anything else about her winter vacation.",
