        "sentence": "You might know that wind vanes tell you which way the wind is blowing and that thermometers tell you how hot or cold it is outside. But did you know that airplanes can be used to study hurricanes? On November 1, 2007, an aircraft flew through a dangerous hurricane. People on the ground controlled the plane, so nobody was inside it. However, it was full of equipment used to take pictures and record data as the plane passed through the storm. While large planes can safely fly over a hurricane, looking at a hurricane from above doesn’t tell scientists everything they want to know. This is because most hurricanes get their energy from warm water in the ocean. Scientists wanted to learn more about what happens where that warm ocean water meets the air in a hurricane. So, they sent in the small remote-controlled plane. The plane studied how clouds form and measured the temperature of the air and water. It also recorded many images of the storm. Scientists are still studying the information they collected using the plane. Many hope it will help them better understand how hurricanes form and move so that people can be better prepared when a hurricane comes.",
