        "sentence": "In the Pacific Ocean near Hawaii, millions of tons of garbage swirl slowly in the water. The remains of bottles, plastic bags, fishing nets, and other items float gently around. This is the Pacific Garbage Patch, and it\u2019s a huge problem. The Pacific Garbage Patch is in a part of the ocean where water moves endlessly in a circle. Trash from thousands of miles away is pulled by ocean currents until it travels to this spot. Most of the garbage is plastic. This is because plastic doesn\u2019t break down easily. It can only break down into small pieces. These small pieces look like food to fish, birds, and other animals. When these animals eat the plastic instead of filling up on real food, they can become sick and starve to death. Scientists worry that this ocean garbage will hurt more than just marine life. Eventually, sick animals can make their way into the human food supply. But right now, nobody is sure how to solve the problem. One thing that does work, though, is to recycle plastics or throw them away properly. Remember, if your soda bottle doesn\u2019t become litter in the first place, it won\u2019t get into the ocean.",
