        "sentence": "Charles sat in the cafeteria with five other students, waiting for Ms. Swanson to interview all of them. Ms. Swanson, the seventh-grade science teacher, was looking for a lab helper. Charles’s palms were sweaty and his face felt hot. He wondered if his face was red—and if anyone would notice. As he prepared for his interview, Charles reviewed a set of index cards with notes that he had made earlier. On each card, he had written an answer to a question that Ms. Swanson might ask. “The emergency eyewash station is not a place to get a drink of water,” he quietly read aloud from one card. Charles decided to check out the other candidates. Nearby, a girl with dark red hair was shuffling her own set of index cards. He watched as she tore a card into tiny pieces and stuffed the pieces into a pocket. Suddenly she looked up at Charles. “Are you nervous?” she asked. “No, I’m not nervous—not at all,” Charles stammered. “What about you?” “Uh, no, me neither,” the girl responded. At that moment, Ms. Swanson appeared. “Charles Locke?” she called out.",
