        "sentence": "If you visit the animal shelter in Salinas, California, you’ll see giant wood cutouts of a dog and a cat. These signs were placed in front of the building to catch people’s attention. The supersized cutouts make people curious and encourage them to visit the shelter—and maybe even adopt a pet. Each year, the Salinas shelter takes in around 2,000 dogs and 2,000 cats. The animals are either strays or are dropped off by people who couldn’t take care of them. Of the 4,000 animals, some of them are eventually adopted into new homes. Some animals are transferred to other shelters. And, unfortunately, some cannot be saved because they are too sick or are considered dangerous. Animal shelters provide food, medicine, and a safe place for animals to sleep. But they are not ideal homes. The shelters are loud, and the animals stay in small cages. The people who work at shelters do their best to care for the animals, but the animals do not always get the attention or exercise they need. To prevent so many animals from becoming homeless, pet owners should take good care of their pets. One of the best ways to care for pets is to spay or neuter them. This surgery prevents cats and dogs from having more babies. And that reduces the number of homeless animals that end up in shelters.",
