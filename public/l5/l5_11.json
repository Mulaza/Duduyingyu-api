{"lesson": {"type": "sentence", "title": "A Sheltered Life", "sentence": "If you visit the animal shelter in Salinas, California, you\u2019ll see giant wood cutouts of a dog and a cat. These signs were placed in front of the building to catch people\u2019s attention. The supersized cutouts make people curious and encourage them to visit the shelter\u2014and maybe even adopt a pet. Each year, the Salinas shelter takes in around 2,000 dogs and 2,000 cats. The animals are either strays or are dropped off by people who couldn\u2019t take care of them. Of the 4,000 animals, some of them are eventually adopted into new homes. Some animals are transferred to other shelters. And, unfortunately, some cannot be saved because they are too sick or are considered dangerous. Animal shelters provide food, medicine, and a safe place for animals to sleep. But they are not ideal homes. The shelters are loud, and the animals stay in small cages. The people who work at shelters do their best to care for the animals, but the animals do not always get the attention or exercise they need. To prevent so many animals from becoming homeless, pet owners should take good care of their pets. One of the best ways to care for pets is to spay or neuter them. This surgery prevents cats and dogs from having more babies. And that reduces the number of homeless animals that end up in shelters.", "key_words": [{"word": "word", "translation": "--", "speech": "\u540d\u8bcd", "example": "N/A"}, {"word": "word", "translation": "--", "speech": "\u540d\u8bcd", "example": "N/A"}]}, "test": [{"type": "scq", "sentence": "What is the passage mainly about", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "The city of salinas, california", "value": "The city of salinas, california"}, {"text_en": "Homeless animals in shelters", "value": "Homeless animals in shelters"}, {"text_en": "How to attract visitors to animal shelters", "value": "How to attract visitors to animal shelters"}, {"text_en": "People who work at animal shelters", "value": "People who work at animal shelters"}]}, {"type": "scq", "sentence": "Dogs in shelters probably do not get enough exercise because ", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "The workers do not enjoy walking them", "value": "The workers do not enjoy walking them"}, {"text_en": "The workers think the dogs will be adopted soon", "value": "The workers think the dogs will be adopted soon"}, {"text_en": "There are too many animals for the workers to care for", "value": "There are too many animals for the workers to care for"}, {"text_en": "The workers are afraid of the dogs", "value": "The workers are afraid of the dogs"}]}, {"type": "scq", "sentence": "What is the result of spaying and neutering", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "More puppies and kittens are adopted", "value": "More puppies and kittens are adopted"}, {"text_en": "Pets need less attention", "value": "Pets need less attention"}, {"text_en": "Fewer animals become homeless", "value": "Fewer animals become homeless"}, {"text_en": "More people work at animal shelters.", "value": "More people work at animal shelters."}]}, {"type": "scq", "sentence": "What can good homes offer that animal shelters cannot", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "Plenty of personal care", "value": "Plenty of personal care"}, {"text_en": "Medical attention", "value": "Medical attention"}, {"text_en": "A safe place to sleep", "value": "A safe place to sleep"}, {"text_en": "Food and water", "value": "Food and water"}]}]}
