        "sentence": "The Cardona family was growing restless. Mr. and Mrs. Cardona had wanted a simple photo taken for their family’s summer newsletter. Ms. Rourke, the photographer, was looking through her camera but wasn’t taking any pictures. “There isn’t enough light on Mr. Cardona’s moustache,” she said to Jamila, her assistant. Jamila sighed, moved the lamp an inch to the left, and glanced at the family. The couple’s two sons were starting to fidget. Jamila knew that they would soon start to complain. It was time to take the picture. “Now Mrs. Cardona’s hair looks too frizzy,” Ms. Rourke remarked. “Jamila, please get the styling products.” When Jamila returned, she noticed that the boys were giggling and poking each other. Their parents’ smiles were drooping under the hot lights. “Oh, now the boys are standing at the wrong angle,” Ms. Rourke announced. Mr. Cardona’s face turned red. His wife looked like she was about to cry. Jamila quickly stepped up to the camera and snapped the picture. “All done!” she said. Everyone looked relieved, except for Ms. Rourke.",
