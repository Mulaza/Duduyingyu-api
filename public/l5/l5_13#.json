        "sentence": "Most people are familiar with plain white table salt. But if you think that salt is just a bunch of tiny white crystals, you’re mistaken. This common seasoning has many different colors and flavors. French sea salt comes from seawater. The larger grains and milder flavor of this salt make it a popular choice for meals. Some people even like to sprinkle it on chocolate cakes and cookies. Hawaiian sea salt, on the other hand, has a rosy color that comes from the clay in the region. The mellow flavor of the salt is perfect for pork dishes. Like Hawaiian sea salt, Australian river salt is also pink. Its color, however, comes from algae in the groundwater. The soft pink flakes melt easily on warm foods. Mediterranean black lava salt resembles tiny cubes of coal. This salt is made by mixing sea salt from the Mediterranean sea with charcoal from volcanic lava. The dark crystals, unlike the other salts mentioned, add a dramatic color contrast to baked potatoes. Sampling different salts is a wonderful way to travel the world without leaving home! Try sprinkling one of the many varieties of salt on your food and enjoy the unique flavor and texture.",
