{"lesson": {"type": "sentence", "title": "Flavoring The Globe", "sentence": "Most people are familiar with plain white table salt. But if you think that salt is just a bunch of tiny white crystals, you\u2019re mistaken. This common seasoning has many different colors and #avors. French sea salt comes from seawater. The larger grains and milder #avor of this salt make it a popular choice for meals. Some people even like to sprinkle it on chocolate cakes and cookies. Hawaiian sea salt, on the other hand, has a rosy color that comes from the clay in the region. The mellow #avor of the salt is perfect for pork dishes. Like Hawaiian sea salt, Australian river salt is also pink. Its color, however, comes from algae in the groundwater. The soft pink #akes melt easily on warm foods. Mediterranean black lava salt resembles tiny cubes of coal. This salt is made by mixing sea salt from the Mediterranean sea with charcoal from volcanic lava. The dark crystals, unlike the other salts mentioned, add a dramatic color contrast to baked potatoes. Sampling different salts is a wonderful way to travel the world without leaving home! Try sprinkling one of the many varieties of salt on your food and enjoy the unique #avor and texture.", "key_words": [{"word": "word", "translation": "--", "speech": "\u540d\u8bcd", "example": "N/A"}, {"word": "word", "translation": "--", "speech": "\u540d\u8bcd", "example": "N/A"}]}, "test": [{"type": "scq", "sentence": "What makes french sea salt popular", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "The dark color", "value": "The dark color"}, {"text_en": "The fine grains", "value": "The fine grains"}, {"text_en": "A chocolate flavor", "value": "A chocolate flavor"}, {"text_en": "A mild taste", "value": "A mild taste"}]}, {"type": "scq", "sentence": "What causes the rosy color of hawaiian sea salt", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "The regional clay", "value": "The regional clay"}, {"text_en": "Algae from underground water", "value": "Algae from underground water"}, {"text_en": "Volcanic lava", "value": "Volcanic lava"}, {"text_en": "Pork", "value": "Pork"}]}, {"type": "scq", "sentence": "Which statement is an opinion", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "Most people are familiar with plain white table salt", "value": "Most people are familiar with plain white table salt"}, {"text_en": "French sea salt comes from seawater", "value": "French sea salt comes from seawater"}, {"text_en": "Australian river salt is pink", "value": "Australian river salt is pink"}, {"text_en": "Sampling different salts is a wonderful way to travel the world without leaving home.", "value": "Sampling different salts is a wonderful way to travel the world without leaving home."}]}, {"type": "scq", "sentence": "How are australian and hawaiian salts similar", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "Both melt easily", "value": "Both melt easily"}, {"text_en": "Both come from the sea", "value": "Both come from the sea"}, {"text_en": "Both are pink", "value": "Both are pink"}, {"text_en": "Both have large grains", "value": "Both have large grains"}]}]}
