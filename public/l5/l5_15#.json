        "sentence": "Some people consider the hardy dandelion to be an annoying weed, despite its sunny yellow blossoms, because it grows quickly and chokes out other plants. These people work hard, therefore, to remove dandelions from their lawns. However, this useful plant has played an important role in American history. And it may even have found its way to your dinner table. Early settlers brought the dandelion from Europe to North America, and, as a result, the aggressive plant spread. But the settlers had a good reason for bringing the plant with them. They relied on dandelions for food and medicine. They ate the green leaves and roasted the roots to make a hot drink. Because dandelion greens are a good source of vitamins and minerals, it is likely that dandelions saved lives during times when food was scarce. You don’t have to be a starving settler to eat tasty dandelion greens. The key is to pick the leaves in the spring, before the flowers form. The young leaves are tender and less bitter. You can add the smaller leaves to salads, but larger leaves should be steamed to bring out the flavor. Put a little salt and olive oil on the greens. You’ll be surprised by how tasty this common weed can be.",
