{"lesson": {"type": "sentence", "title": "Dandelions To The Rescue", "sentence": "Some people consider the hardy dandelion to be an annoying weed, despite its sunny yellow blossoms, because it grows quickly and chokes out other plants. These people work hard, therefore, to remove dandelions from their lawns. However, this useful plant has played an important role in American history. And it may even have found its way to your dinner table. Early settlers brought the dandelion from Europe to North America, and, as a result, the aggressive plant spread. But the settlers had a good reason for bringing the plant with them. They relied on dandelions for food and medicine. They ate the green leaves and roasted the roots to make a hot drink. Because dandelion greens are a good source of vitamins and minerals, it is likely that dandelions saved lives during times when food was scarce. You don\u2019t have to be a starving settler to eat tasty dandelion greens. The key is to pick the leaves in the spring, before the #owers form. The young leaves are tender and less bitter. You can add the smaller leaves to salads, but larger leaves should be steamed to bring out the #avor. Put a little salt and olive oil on the greens. You\u2019ll be surprised by how tasty this common weed can be.", "key_words": [{"word": "word", "translation": "--", "speech": "\u540d\u8bcd", "example": "N/A"}, {"word": "word", "translation": "--", "speech": "\u540d\u8bcd", "example": "N/A"}]}, "test": [{"type": "scq", "sentence": "Which statement is an opinion", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "Dandelions have a delicious flavor", "value": "Dandelions have a delicious flavor"}, {"text_en": "Settlers got vitamins from dandelions", "value": "Settlers got vitamins from dandelions"}, {"text_en": "Settlers brought the plant to north america", "value": "Settlers brought the plant to north america"}, {"text_en": "People today still eat dandelions.", "value": "People today still eat dandelions."}]}, {"type": "scq", "sentence": "Based on information in the passage, how did dandelions most likely save lives", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "The flowers were a source of food for farm animals", "value": "The flowers were a source of food for farm animals"}, {"text_en": "The greens provided vitamins and minerals", "value": "The greens provided vitamins and minerals"}, {"text_en": "Dandelions were the only healthful food available", "value": "Dandelions were the only healthful food available"}, {"text_en": "The roots were a good source of water.", "value": "The roots were a good source of water."}]}, {"type": "scq", "sentence": "Dandelion leaves should be picked early in the spring because they ", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "Have more vitamins then", "value": "Have more vitamins then"}, {"text_en": "Become bitter as they grow", "value": "Become bitter as they grow"}, {"text_en": "Require less salt and olive oil then", "value": "Require less salt and olive oil then"}, {"text_en": "Are easier to find growing in lawns", "value": "Are easier to find growing in lawns"}]}, {"type": "scq", "sentence": "Dandelions are weeds because ", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "They take over where other plants grow", "value": "They take over where other plants grow"}, {"text_en": "They are a good source of vitamins", "value": "They are a good source of vitamins"}, {"text_en": "They grow in lawns", "value": "They grow in lawns"}, {"text_en": "No one grows them as food", "value": "No one grows them as food"}]}]}
