{"lesson": {"type": "sentence", "title": "A Tasty Accident", "sentence": "Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna, a former president of Mexico, was living in New York in the late 1860s. While he was there, he met with Thomas Adams, an inventor. Santa Anna shared with Adams his idea for an invention\u2014a new process, really, for making rubber products such as tires. Rubber is a natural product, but it\u2019s expensive. Santa Anna thought it would be possible to blend the rubber with chicle (CHIK-ul), the milky juice of a tropical tree. That would make rubber products much cheaper to produce. Adams told Santa Anna that he was willing to try. Later, Santa Anna arranged for one ton of chicle to be shipped to Adams from Mexico. Adams experimented for about a year, trying different blends of rubber and chicle. None of them were successful. The inventor still had plenty of chicle left over and wondered what to do with it. Then he remembered Santa Anna\u2019s stories of people chewing chicle in Mexico. So Adams made a small batch of chewing gum, packaged it, and sold it in local stores. The soft and springy gum was much tastier than other American gum, which was made from wax or tree sap. Although Adams\u2019s original idea was a failure, chewing gum was a success. In 1871, he invented a machine to manufacture gum so he wouldn\u2019t have to make it by hand. Adams enjoyed success for the rest of his life, and people have enjoyed all kinds of tasty gum for years.", "key_words": [{"word": "word", "translation": "--", "speech": "\u540d\u8bcd", "example": "N/A"}, {"word": "word", "translation": "--", "speech": "\u540d\u8bcd", "example": "N/A"}]}, "test": [{"type": "scq", "sentence": "Which event happened after adams experimented with chicle", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "He met santa anna", "value": "He met santa anna"}, {"text_en": "He invented a machine to make gum", "value": "He invented a machine to make gum"}, {"text_en": "Santa anna became president of mexico", "value": "Santa anna became president of mexico"}, {"text_en": "Americans began to chew wax gum.", "value": "Americans began to chew wax gum."}]}, {"type": "scq", "sentence": "What happened as a result of the failed experiments with rubber", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "Santa anna told adams about chewing chicle", "value": "Santa anna told adams about chewing chicle"}, {"text_en": "Santa anna moved to new york", "value": "Santa anna moved to new york"}, {"text_en": "Adams made chewing gum from chicle", "value": "Adams made chewing gum from chicle"}, {"text_en": "Adams received one ton of chicle.", "value": "Adams received one ton of chicle."}]}, {"type": "scq", "sentence": "Which statement expresses an opinion", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "Adamss gum was tasty", "value": "Adamss gum was tasty"}, {"text_en": "Chicle comes from the juice of a tree", "value": "Chicle comes from the juice of a tree"}, {"text_en": "Rubber is a natural product", "value": "Rubber is a natural product"}, {"text_en": "Santa anna lived in new york.", "value": "Santa anna lived in new york."}]}, {"type": "scq", "sentence": "Which event happened first", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "Adams invented a machine to make gum", "value": "Adams invented a machine to make gum"}, {"text_en": "Adams experimented with chicle", "value": "Adams experimented with chicle"}, {"text_en": "Adams received a shipment of chicle", "value": "Adams received a shipment of chicle"}, {"text_en": "Adams learned about chicle from santa anna", "value": "Adams learned about chicle from santa anna"}]}]}
