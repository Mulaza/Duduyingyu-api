        "sentence": "Tina took the helmet from Dale, the rafting instructor who would be guiding the group down the river. Tina pushed her hair out of her face and fitted the helmet on her head. Then she fastened the strap. “I’ve never had to wear a helmet on a boat before,” she complained. “This isn’t really a boat,” said Dale. “It’s a raft,” he explained in a casual tone. “A raft is filled with air and it doesn’t have an engine.” Dale picked up a stack of life jackets and began distributing them to people as they waited to climb into the raft. “We’ll hit some choppy water in the river,” he told everyone. “And we want all of you to be safe.” “But I feel silly in this helmet,” Tina said. “Do I really need it?” Stepping forward to get a life jacket, she caught her foot in a rope that was coiled up near the raft. Tina stumbled forward in surprise and, with a shriek, fell down onto the pile of rope. Dale smiled at Tina as she untangled herself. “Yes, you really do need it,” he answered, holding out his hand to help Tina up. Tina stood up carefully. “You know,” she said, “I think you’re right.”",
