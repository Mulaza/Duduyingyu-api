{"lesson": {"type": "sentence", "title": "The Rarest Beef", "sentence": "If you like hamburgers, you\u2019d probably love a Kobe burger. Kobe beef comes from a rare type of cattle, called Wagyu. Technically, these cattle are raised only in the Kobe region of Japan. Kobe beef is prized for its #avor, tenderness, and delicate texture. Wagyu cattle are raised on small farms in the lush green countryside of Japan, where farmland is scarce and, therefore, expensive. The cows have a special diet and are treated well. They even receive massages as a way to relax them and stimulate their muscles. Compared to typical cattle ranches, which tend to be crowded, Kobe farms are like paradise for the cattle. As you might have guessed, Kobe beef is expensive. A Kobe steak can cost $100 per pound. By comparison, most American-raised beef costs less than $10 per pound. Today, some U.S. ranchers raise Wagyu cattle crossed with Angus beef cattle. They call the meat Kobe-style beef, and many meat-lovers believe that the meat is quite tasty\u2014even though the cows probably do not get massages.", "key_words": [{"word": "word", "translation": "--", "speech": "\u540d\u8bcd", "example": "N/A"}, {"word": "word", "translation": "--", "speech": "\u540d\u8bcd", "example": "N/A"}]}, "test": [{"type": "scq", "sentence": "Kobe beef tastes different because ", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "The cattle farms are crowded", "value": "The cattle farms are crowded"}, {"text_en": "The flavor and texture are prized", "value": "The flavor and texture are prized"}, {"text_en": "The cows eat special food", "value": "The cows eat special food"}, {"text_en": "It costs only $10 per pound", "value": "It costs only $10 per pound"}]}, {"type": "scq", "sentence": "The authors main purpose is to ", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "Give an opinion about the cost of beef", "value": "Give an opinion about the cost of beef"}, {"text_en": "Explain the best ways to raise cattle", "value": "Explain the best ways to raise cattle"}, {"text_en": "Convince readers not to eat american meat", "value": "Convince readers not to eat american meat"}, {"text_en": "Inform readers about an unusual food", "value": "Inform readers about an unusual food"}]}, {"type": "scq", "sentence": "How is american-raised beef different from japanese kobe beef", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "It has a better flavor", "value": "It has a better flavor"}, {"text_en": "It is less expensive", "value": "It is less expensive"}, {"text_en": "It comes from cows raised on small farms", "value": "It comes from cows raised on small farms"}, {"text_en": "It comes from cows that get massages.", "value": "It comes from cows that get massages."}]}, {"type": "scq", "sentence": "Why does the author compare the size of kobe farms to typical cattle ranches", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "To say how to improve american ranches", "value": "To say how to improve american ranches"}, {"text_en": "To show that kobe farms are better for cattle", "value": "To show that kobe farms are better for cattle"}, {"text_en": "To explain why wagyu cattle get massages", "value": "To explain why wagyu cattle get massages"}, {"text_en": "To show how large wagyu cattle are", "value": "To show how large wagyu cattle are"}]}]}
