        "sentence": "Floating, airborne, and focused—these words have often been used to describe how Julius “Dr. J” Erving played basketball. Erving became one of the best players in the sport. He forever changed the way people played basketball. Erving started playing professional basketball in the 1970s. The sport was different then. It was mainly a floor game, with players running back and forth across the court. Unlike other players, Erving found that his skill was in the air, because he could leap far and high. He soon became known for his slam-dunks, which were not as common in the 1970s as they are today. Most players scored by throwing the ball toward the basket from far away. But Erving flew toward the board with the ball in hand, spinning his body in the air before sending the ball down through the hoop. This tremendous skill helped the teams he played for win three championships. Dr. J says of his life, “I saw that basketball could be my way out, and I worked hard to make sure it was.” This inspiring athlete discovered his unique skill early on and used it to his advantage throughout his life.",
