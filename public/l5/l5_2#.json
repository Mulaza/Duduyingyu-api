        "sentence": "Jamie was tired. She had been on her feet for hours. Her mom owned a small but busy restaurant in town. Three of her mom’s employees had called in sick that morning. There was a big festival in the city park that day, and Jamie had wanted to go. But her mom had asked for her help at the restaurant. All Jamie wanted to do was sit down for a while. Instead, she hurried around the restaurant, taking orders and refilling coffee cups. As soon as one table was cleared, a new set of customers walked in. The customers just kept coming! That meant more orders and more coffee. “Order up!” called the cook from the kitchen. Jamie stared at the kitchen. She thought about all of the food stalls at the festival. Cooks there were preparing special foods from all over the world. Jamie imagined the delicious smells of new and exotic foods. “Hurry, Jamie!” the cook called, catching Jamie lost in thought. “I’m coming,” Jamie grumbled. But her mom had already picked up the plates of hot food from the counter and delivered them to a table by the window. “Wake up, Jamie,” her mom said. “I know you don’t want to be here, but I need your help.”",
