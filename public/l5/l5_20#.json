        "sentence": "Think of the biggest meal you’ve ever eaten. It’s likely that Sonya Thomas has eaten a lot more than that. The petite woman weighs only about 100 pounds, yet she has smashed national and international records in competitive eating. Competitive eating events are contests to see who can eat the most of a certain kind of food in a set amount of time. When it comes to this competition, dainty diners need not apply. Have you ever eaten lobster? Sonya can eat 44 of them in 12 minutes. How about french fries covered in chili and cheese? Sonya once ate more than 8 pounds of them in 10 minutes. Sonya has eaten 65 hard-boiled eggs in 6 minutes and 40 seconds. That’s about half the time it takes to cook a single egg! You might eat a slice of cheesecake for dessert. Sonya once consumed 11 pounds of this rich dessert in just 9 minutes. Sonya stays in shape by eating lots of fruits and vegetables and by avoiding junk food, except in competitions. She also exercises regularly. These habits not only help keep Sonya Thomas healthy but allow her to perform better in competitions.",
