It\u2019s likely that Sonya Thomas has eaten a lot more than that. The petite woman weighs only about 100 pounds, yet she has smashed national and international records in competitive eating. Competitive eating events are contests to see who can eat the most of a certain kind of food in a set amount of time. When it comes to this competition, dainty diners need not apply. Have you ever eaten lobster? Sonya can eat 44 of them in 12 minutes. How about french fries covered in chili and cheese? Sonya once ate more than 8 pounds of them in 10 minutes. Sonya has eaten 65 hard-boiled eggs in 6 minutes and 40 seconds. That\u2019s about half the time it takes to cook a single egg! You might eat a slice of cheesecake for dessert. Sonya once consumed 11 pounds of this rich dessert in just 9 minutes. Sonya stays in shape by eating lots of fruits and vegetables and by avoiding junk food, except in competitions. She also exercises regularly. These habits not only help keep Sonya Thomas healthy but allow her to perform better in competitions.", "key_words": [{"word": "word", "translation": "--", "speech": "\u540d\u8bcd", "example": "N/A"}, {"word": "word", "translation": "--", "speech": "\u540d\u8bcd", "example": "N/A"}]}, "test": [{"type": "scq", "sentence": "What is one theme of the passage", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "Dieting is important for good health", "value": "Dieting is important for good health"}, {"text_en": "Exercise is important for good health", "value": "Exercise is important for good health"}, {"text_en": "Even competitive eaters can stay in shape", "value": "Even competitive eaters can stay in shape"}, {"text_en": "To win, competitive eaters must be dainty eaters.", "value": "To win, competitive eaters must be dainty eaters."}]}, {"type": "scq", "sentence": "How are all eating contests alike", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "Participants are weighed beforehand", "value": "Participants are weighed beforehand"}, {"text_en": "Participants must enjoy the food", "value": "Participants must enjoy the food"}, {"text_en": "Each event lasts only 10 minutes", "value": "Each event lasts only 10 minutes"}, {"text_en": "Each event is timed.", "value": "Each event is timed."}]}, {"type": "scq", "sentence": "How are competitive eaters different from regular eaters", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "Competitive eaters usually weigh less", "value": "Competitive eaters usually weigh less"}, {"text_en": "Regular eaters do not eat junk food", "value": "Regular eaters do not eat junk food"}, {"text_en": "Competitive eaters eat more food in less time", "value": "Competitive eaters eat more food in less time"}, {"text_en": "Regular eaters do not like competition.", "value": "Regular eaters do not like competition."}]}, {"type": "scq", "sentence": "Why does the author mention sonyas weight", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "To encourage readers to eat healthy foods", "value": "To encourage readers to eat healthy foods"}, {"text_en": "To persuade readers to try competitive eating", "value": "To persuade readers to try competitive eating"}, {"text_en": "To prove that appearance can be misleading", "value": "To prove that appearance can be misleading"}, {"text_en": "To explain why sonya is successful", "value": "To explain why sonya is successful"}]}]}
