{"lesson": {"type": "sentence", "title": "Dog Of The Millennium", "sentence": "You may have heard of dogs that can shake hands and roll over, but have you ever heard of a dog that knows more than 100 commands? For Endal, a yellow Labrador retriever, learning all those commands was just part of his job as a service dog. After naval officer Allen Parton suffered an injury in the Gulf War and was con\"ned to a wheelchair, Endal came to live with Parton to help him recover from his injuries and resume a normal life. Endal had to learn a lot in order to help his human partner. He learned to stand on his hind legs to pay for and collect a bus ticket. He even learned how to use a credit card at the grocery store! One time when Parton was struck by a car and thrown from his wheelchair, Endal covered him with a blanket, brought him a mobile phone, and alerted help. Endal\u2019s quick thinking and helpful response explains why Parton thought of the dog more as a partner than as a pet. It\u2019s no wonder that this wonder dog was named \u201cDog of the Millennium\u201d by Dogs Today in 2002. When Endal passed away at the age of 13, Parton felt sad but grateful. \u201cHe will be missed, but I really want to celebrate his life,\u201d Parton said.", "key_words": [{"word": "word", "translation": "--", "speech": "\u540d\u8bcd", "example": "N/A"}, {"word": "word", "translation": "--", "speech": "\u540d\u8bcd", "example": "N/A"}]}, "test": [{"type": "scq", "sentence": "What is the main idea of the passage", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "Labrador retrievers make good pets", "value": "Labrador retrievers make good pets"}, {"text_en": "Endal was a well-trained service dog and a good friend", "value": "Endal was a well-trained service dog and a good friend"}, {"text_en": "Endal knew a lot of commands", "value": "Endal knew a lot of commands"}, {"text_en": "Allen parton eventually resumed a normal life.", "value": "Allen parton eventually resumed a normal life."}]}, {"type": "scq", "sentence": "According to the passage, when did endal enter allen partons life", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "After parton was injured in the gulf war", "value": "After parton was injured in the gulf war"}, {"text_en": "After endal was named dog of the millennium", "value": "After endal was named dog of the millennium"}, {"text_en": "After parton was hit by a car", "value": "After parton was hit by a car"}, {"text_en": "Before endal learned any commands", "value": "Before endal learned any commands"}]}, {"type": "scq", "sentence": "Which of these was not mentioned as one of endals special skills", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "Buying a bus ticket", "value": "Buying a bus ticket"}, {"text_en": "Using a credit card", "value": "Using a credit card"}, {"text_en": "Shaking hands and rolling over", "value": "Shaking hands and rolling over"}, {"text_en": "Fetching a mobile phone", "value": "Fetching a mobile phone"}]}, {"type": "scq", "sentence": "Where does the title of the passage come from", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "The lessons endal learned over time", "value": "The lessons endal learned over time"}, {"text_en": "The name that parton called endal most often", "value": "The name that parton called endal most often"}, {"text_en": "The name that endal received from his service training program", "value": "The name that endal received from his service training program"}, {"text_en": "The name given to endal by dogs today magazine", "value": "The name given to endal by dogs today magazine"}]}]}
