{"lesson": {"type": "sentence", "title": "Mira\u2019S Visit", "sentence": "From the moment the airplane touched down at the Hong Kong airport, Mira knew she was in for an adventure. The busy airport was full of people bustling about. The people looked like they came from all over the world. Mira heard bits of conversation in many different languages. Mira and her parents hurried to the hotel, where they checked in and dropped off their luggage. They were eager to begin exploring the city. Mira\u2019s dad brought a map and a detailed plan of what sights they would see. The \"rst stop on the list was the Hong Kong Wetland Park, just outside the city. The peaceful park had lots of places to walk, and Mira enjoyed sketching pictures of wildlife, including a crocodile lounging beside its private pool. On the train back to the city, the family marveled at the towering skyscrapers. Next, they stopped at the Science Museum, where Mira and her mom visited the World of Mirrors exhibit. After a lunch of local treats from a street-food cart, the family rushed to Victoria Harbor for the \u201cSymphony of Lights.\u201d In the light show, beams of light were projected onto the buildings around the harbor and re#ected off the calm waters below. The family returned to the hotel, ready for a good night\u2019s sleep. Mira looked forward to another day of fun in Hong Kong. She was amazed to think of all they had done on their \"rst day!", "key_words": [{"word": "word", "translation": "--", "speech": "\u540d\u8bcd", "example": "N/A"}, {"word": "word", "translation": "--", "speech": "\u540d\u8bcd", "example": "N/A"}]}, "test": [{"type": "scq", "sentence": "What did mira and her family do before exploring hong kong", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "They ate a meal at a street cart", "value": "They ate a meal at a street cart"}, {"text_en": "They left their luggage at the hotel", "value": "They left their luggage at the hotel"}, {"text_en": "They marveled at the citys skyscrapers", "value": "They marveled at the citys skyscrapers"}, {"text_en": "They rode on a train.", "value": "They rode on a train."}]}, {"type": "scq", "sentence": "What did the family plan to do first", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "See a light show at the harbor", "value": "See a light show at the harbor"}, {"text_en": "Go to a science museum", "value": "Go to a science museum"}, {"text_en": "Go to a wildlife park", "value": "Go to a wildlife park"}, {"text_en": "Enjoy lunch", "value": "Enjoy lunch"}]}, {"type": "scq", "sentence": "When did the family eat lunch", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "After leaving the science museum", "value": "After leaving the science museum"}, {"text_en": "Before visiting the world of mirrors exhibit", "value": "Before visiting the world of mirrors exhibit"}, {"text_en": "After watching the symphony of lights", "value": "After watching the symphony of lights"}, {"text_en": "After taking a nap at the hotel", "value": "After taking a nap at the hotel"}]}, {"type": "scq", "sentence": "When did mira first realize that hong kong was probably a busy city", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "When she sketched a crocodile", "value": "When she sketched a crocodile"}, {"text_en": "When she saw the towering skyscrapers", "value": "When she saw the towering skyscrapers"}, {"text_en": "When she and her family returned to the hotel", "value": "When she and her family returned to the hotel"}, {"text_en": "When she and her family arrived at the airport", "value": "When she and her family arrived at the airport"}]}]}
