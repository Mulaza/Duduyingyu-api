Looking closer, however, he noticed the instructions. He ran across the beach to show it to his older sister. \u201cNina! Look at this!\u201d he shouted, waving the map in her face. \u201cWhat does it say?\u201d Nina stopped working on her sand castle and took the map from Alex\u2019s hands. \u201c\u2018Start at the dock and take three steps toward the water,\u2019\u201d she read aloud. \u201c\u2018Turn to the right and walk 20 steps.

He grabbed the map and struggled to sound out the words, reading slowly. \u201c\u2018Carry the key to the old boathouse.\u2019 Where\u2019s the boathouse, Nina?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s over there,\u201d said Nina as she pointed toward the dock. \u201cThe instructions say to look for a yellow bird cage and then \"nd a second key. Where did you get this map, Alex?\u201d Alex pointed toward a cluster of beach umbrellas. \u201cDad gave it to me,\u201d he said. Nina thought she could see their father pretending to read while he watched them talk, but he quickly ducked back behind his book. \u201cHe said a pirate gave it to him!\u201d Alex exclaimed. \u201cI see,\u201d Nina said. She thought for a moment and then smiled brightly. \u201cWell, let\u2019s go \"nd some treasure.\u201d", "key_words": [{"word": "word", "translation": "--", "speech": "\u540d\u8bcd", "example": "N/A"}, {"word": "word", "translation": "--", "speech": "\u540d\u8bcd", "example": "N/A"}]}, "test": [{"type": "scq", "sentence": "What did alex think the treasure map was at first", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "A list of instructions", "value": "A list of instructions"}, {"text_en": "Part of a beach umbrella", "value": "Part of a beach umbrella"}, {"text_en": "A page from his fathers book", "value": "A page from his fathers book"}, {"text_en": "An old piece of newspaper", "value": "An old piece of newspaper"}]}, {"type": "scq", "sentence": "What is the first instruction on the treasure map", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "Dig one foot down", "value": "Dig one foot down"}, {"text_en": "Start at the dock", "value": "Start at the dock"}, {"text_en": "Look for the yellow birdcage", "value": "Look for the yellow birdcage"}, {"text_en": "Find a second map", "value": "Find a second map"}]}, {"type": "scq", "sentence": "How did alex get the treasure map", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "His sister found it in a sand castle", "value": "His sister found it in a sand castle"}, {"text_en": "A pirate gave him directions to it", "value": "A pirate gave him directions to it"}, {"text_en": "His father gave it to him", "value": "His father gave it to him"}, {"text_en": "He found it in a book.", "value": "He found it in a book."}]}, {"type": "scq", "sentence": "What does the map tell nina and alex to do after they find the oar house", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "Find the first key", "value": "Find the first key"}, {"text_en": "Walk 20 paces to the right", "value": "Walk 20 paces to the right"}, {"text_en": "Look for a yellow birdcage", "value": "Look for a yellow birdcage"}, {"text_en": "Find a cluster of beach umbrellas", "value": "Find a cluster of beach umbrellas"}]}]}
