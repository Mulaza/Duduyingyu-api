{"lesson": {"type": "sentence", "title": "Handmade Memories", "sentence": "Paper plays a major role in much of our lives, from books and magazines to birthday cards and notebook paper. For many people, making their own paper is a way of expressing their personalities. It is also a fun recycling project. Making paper requires only a few special tools, including a blender and a small wire mesh screen. You can use computer paper, old cards, letters, and construction paper as your basic papermaking materials. If you want to make a darker paper, try using or adding newspaper. Materials such as colored string, rose petals, or even old bluejeans can add interesting tints and textures to your paper. To start, tear or cut up the old paper you are using into small pieces. Add the cut pieces to warm water, and process the mixture in a blender until it is thick and soupy. Then, add any other materials you want to use, such as bits of string. Next, spread the mixture on a screen. Using a cloth, press all the moisture out of the paper through the screen. Then, carefully peel the damp paper away from the screen and let it dry for a few hours. When it has dried, you can use your paper in any way you choose. Making your own paper allows you to add your special touch to an everyday material. Just think of all the people you could impress with your handmade paper gifts!", "key_words": [{"word": "word", "translation": "--", "speech": "\u540d\u8bcd", "example": "N/A"}, {"word": "word", "translation": "--", "speech": "\u540d\u8bcd", "example": "N/A"}]}, "test": [{"type": "scq", "sentence": "Which material would probably not give handmade paper an interesting color", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "Green construction paper", "value": "Green construction paper"}, {"text_en": "Rose petals", "value": "Rose petals"}, {"text_en": "Old bluejeans", "value": "Old bluejeans"}, {"text_en": "White string", "value": "White string"}]}, {"type": "scq", "sentence": "Why do you press the soupy mixture onto a screen, according to the passage", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "To give the paper an interesting texture", "value": "To give the paper an interesting texture"}, {"text_en": "To get the moisture out", "value": "To get the moisture out"}, {"text_en": "To thicken the mixture", "value": "To thicken the mixture"}, {"text_en": "To make the paper darker", "value": "To make the paper darker"}]}, {"type": "scq", "sentence": "You probably tear or cut up the paper before putting it in the blender to ", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "Hide any writing on the old paper", "value": "Hide any writing on the old paper"}, {"text_en": "Personalize the look of the finished paper", "value": "Personalize the look of the finished paper"}, {"text_en": "Make the paper easier for the blender to shred", "value": "Make the paper easier for the blender to shred"}, {"text_en": "Give the paper an interesting texture", "value": "Give the paper an interesting texture"}]}, {"type": "scq", "sentence": "A blender works well for making paper because ", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "It does not cost much money", "value": "It does not cost much money"}, {"text_en": "Almost everyone owns one", "value": "Almost everyone owns one"}, {"text_en": "It shreds and mixes the materials", "value": "It shreds and mixes the materials"}, {"text_en": "It keeps the water warm", "value": "It keeps the water warm"}]}]}
