{"lesson": {"type": "sentence", "title": "A Pyramid In Wyoming", "sentence": "When you think of pyramids, you probably picture one in Egypt or Mexico. Did you know that there is also a pyramid in the United States? Not many people do. You can \"nd the pyramid, called the Ames Monument, off a quiet dirt road in the southeast corner of Wyoming. Back in the 1800s, two brothers named Oliver and Oakes Ames worked with the Union Paci\"c Railroad to build railroad tracks that stretched across the country. This was a spectacular feat. However, Oakes was later charged with dishonest business practices, so the Ames brothers and the railroad company gained a bad reputation. After the Ames brothers died, the people who ran Union Paci\"c wanted to restore the company\u2019s public image. So they built a monument near Sherman, a quiet town at the highest point along the rail line. The builder used blocks of pink granite found in the area to construct the monument\u2014a 60-foot pyramid. An artist added two 9-foot-tall carved portraits, one of each Ames brother. At one time, train passengers traveling through the area could get off the train and view the pyramid up close. However, since then, the railroad tracks have been moved and the town of Sherman no longer exists. Few people come to see the Ames Monument anymore, and the odd structure has fallen into disrepair. As a result, this pyramid may eventually vanish into history.", "key_words": [{"word": "word", "translation": "--", "speech": "\u540d\u8bcd", "example": "N/A"}, {"word": "word", "translation": "--", "speech": "\u540d\u8bcd", "example": "N/A"}]}, "test": [{"type": "scq", "sentence": "According to the passage, why did union pacific build the pyramid", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "To give passengers something to look at", "value": "To give passengers something to look at"}, {"text_en": "To improve the railroads public image", "value": "To improve the railroads public image"}, {"text_en": "To impress the ames brothers", "value": "To impress the ames brothers"}, {"text_en": "To compete with egyptian pyramids", "value": "To compete with egyptian pyramids"}]}, {"type": "scq", "sentence": "Which of these was an effect of oakes ames being charged with dishonest business practices", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "The ames brothers moved to sherman", "value": "The ames brothers moved to sherman"}, {"text_en": "People stopped taking the train", "value": "People stopped taking the train"}, {"text_en": "Union pacific gained a bad reputation", "value": "Union pacific gained a bad reputation"}, {"text_en": "An artist carved oakes amess portrait.", "value": "An artist carved oakes amess portrait."}]}, {"type": "scq", "sentence": "According to the passage, why might the pyramid vanish into history", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "It is already falling apart", "value": "It is already falling apart"}, {"text_en": "The railroad tracks were moved", "value": "The railroad tracks were moved"}, {"text_en": "The town of sherman no longer exists", "value": "The town of sherman no longer exists"}, {"text_en": "People do not remember the ames brothers.", "value": "People do not remember the ames brothers."}]}, {"type": "scq", "sentence": "What is the most likely reason that few people visit the pyramid today", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "Passenger trains no longer stop there", "value": "Passenger trains no longer stop there"}, {"text_en": "Union pacific built a different monument", "value": "Union pacific built a different monument"}, {"text_en": "The ames brothers died", "value": "The ames brothers died"}, {"text_en": "The pyramid is in disrepair.", "value": "The pyramid is in disrepair."}]}]}
