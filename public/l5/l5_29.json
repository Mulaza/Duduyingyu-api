{"lesson": {"type": "sentence", "title": "Good Luck Charm", "sentence": "Deisha paced back and forth as she waited backstage. This would be her most important piano performance yet. At ten years old, she was the youngest performer in the recital. She had practiced playing her song more than 30 times that week. When she closed her eyes at night, the music played over and over again in her head. Now that the day had arrived, Deisha was not sure she was ready. She smoothed her hair and picked a piece of lint from the new dress that her mother had bought for her. She noticed that her hands were shaking. How could she play the notes of the song if her hands were shaking? She tried to concentrate on steadying them, but they only shook more. Deisha\u2019s piano teacher, Ms. Neal, leaned down to speak to her. \u201cI have something for you,\u201d she said, pressing a smooth black stone into Deisha\u2019s hand. \u201cIt\u2019s a special stone. There\u2019s no other one like it in the world. You\u2019ve practiced so much, you don\u2019t need anything else.\u201d The stage lights re#ected off the polished rock. \u201cThank you,\u201d Deisha said. When Deisha\u2019s name was called, she rubbed the stone, stepped onto the stage, and played better than ever. After her performance, she noticed that Ms. Neal had a whole bag of black stones. \u201cWhy did you say this one was so special?\u201d she asked. Her teacher responded, \u201cBecause, like your talent, it belongs only to you.\u201d", "key_words": [{"word": "word", "translation": "--", "speech": "\u540d\u8bcd", "example": "N/A"}, {"word": "word", "translation": "--", "speech": "\u540d\u8bcd", "example": "N/A"}]}, "test": [{"type": "scq", "sentence": "Deisha most likely hears the piano music in her head at night because ", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "She has practiced so much", "value": "She has practiced so much"}, {"text_en": "She listened to a recording of it earlier", "value": "She listened to a recording of it earlier"}, {"text_en": "It is her teachers favorite song", "value": "It is her teachers favorite song"}, {"text_en": "She wants to remember it forever", "value": "She wants to remember it forever"}]}, {"type": "scq", "sentence": "Why does deisha practice more than 30 times during the week", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "She wants to be prepared for the recital", "value": "She wants to be prepared for the recital"}, {"text_en": "She has nothing better to do", "value": "She has nothing better to do"}, {"text_en": "Ms. neal tells her to do so", "value": "Ms. neal tells her to do so"}, {"text_en": "She wants to earn a good luck charm.", "value": "She wants to earn a good luck charm."}]}, {"type": "scq", "sentence": "Which of these is a fact", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "Performing in front of people is scary", "value": "Performing in front of people is scary"}, {"text_en": "Playing the piano is difficult", "value": "Playing the piano is difficult"}, {"text_en": "Being nervous can make your hands shake", "value": "Being nervous can make your hands shake"}, {"text_en": "Deisha should not be nervous.", "value": "Deisha should not be nervous."}]}, {"type": "scq", "sentence": "Which statement suggests what the author probably believes", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "Practice leads to a perfect performance", "value": "Practice leads to a perfect performance"}, {"text_en": "Rubbing a stone can bring good luck", "value": "Rubbing a stone can bring good luck"}, {"text_en": "A new dress can bring good luck", "value": "A new dress can bring good luck"}, {"text_en": "People are talented in their own way", "value": "People are talented in their own way"}]}]}
