{"lesson": {"type": "sentence", "title": "The Lawn Chair Flyer", "sentence": "Larry Walters was a truck driver who always dreamed of #ying. When he couldn\u2019t get into the U.S. Air Force, he came up with a new plan. One sunny day in July of 1982, Larry made history when he took #ight in a homemade aircraft near Los Angeles, California. Larry tied 45 weather balloons to a lawn chair and used helium tanks to \"ll the balloons. Sitting in his sturdy chair like the proud captain of a ship, he ordered his friends to cut the anchor rope. But instead of rising slowly to a height of 100 feet as he had expected, Larry\u2019s aircraft rushed skyward. It rose to over 16,000 feet in the air. The truck driver with no #ight experience was suddenly in airplane territory\u2014in a lawn chair. Fortunately, Larry had brought along a pellet gun and a two-way radio. He used the radio to communicate with surprised emergency officials. He also shot a few balloons with the pellet gun to lower his aircraft. However, the lawn chair eventually drifted into some power lines, causing a power outage in the nearby city of Long Beach. After his historic #ight, Larry had to pay a \"ne to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for #ying an uncerti\"ed aircraft. He complained that the Wright brothers, inventors of the \"rst airplane, had also #own uncerti\"ed aircraft. Later, Larry said, \u201cI ful\"lled my dream. But I wouldn\u2019t do this again for anything.\u201d", "key_words": [{"word": "word", "translation": "--", "speech": "\u540d\u8bcd", "example": "N/A"}, {"word": "word", "translation": "--", "speech": "\u540d\u8bcd", "example": "N/A"}]}, "test": [{"type": "scq", "sentence": "How was larrys lawn chair aircraft similar to most aircraft", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "It was certified for flight", "value": "It was certified for flight"}, {"text_en": "It was propelled by balloons", "value": "It was propelled by balloons"}, {"text_en": "It rose to a high altitude", "value": "It rose to a high altitude"}, {"text_en": "It was able to land safely.", "value": "It was able to land safely."}]}, {"type": "scq", "sentence": "How is larry similar to the wright brothers", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "Both experimented with flight", "value": "Both experimented with flight"}, {"text_en": "Both had legal issues with the f aa", "value": "Both had legal issues with the f aa"}, {"text_en": "Neither had successful flights", "value": "Neither had successful flights"}, {"text_en": "Neither are recognized by history.", "value": "Neither are recognized by history."}]}, {"type": "scq", "sentence": "The author compares larry to the proud captain of a ship because larry ", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "Was proud of his job", "value": "Was proud of his job"}, {"text_en": "Was proud of his weather balloons", "value": "Was proud of his weather balloons"}, {"text_en": "Was proud of his friends", "value": "Was proud of his friends"}, {"text_en": "Was proud of his chair", "value": "Was proud of his chair"}]}, {"type": "scq", "sentence": "How was larrys flight different than he expected", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "It was very expensive", "value": "It was very expensive"}, {"text_en": "He flew higher than he thought he would", "value": "He flew higher than he thought he would"}, {"text_en": "The chair broke", "value": "The chair broke"}, {"text_en": "The balloons popped when he shot them", "value": "The balloons popped when he shot them"}]}]}
