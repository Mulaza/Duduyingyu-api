However, although scientists know some important facts about Earth\u2019s crust, many details are a mystery. To solve some of those mysteries, a group of Russian scientists drilled the deepest hole on the planet. Starting in the 1960s, researchers and special drillers began digging and drilling a hole in the northwestern part of Russia, on the Kola Peninsula. Before they were done, the Kola Superdeep Borehole was more than 7.5 miles deep. Researchers unearthed many fascinating facts. Miles below the surface, they found rock that was full of water, like a sponge. Scientists believed that the water had formed from extreme pressure inside the rock. The researchers also found a layer of tiny fossils about four miles down, deeper than anyone expected to \"nd fossils. Another surprise was that Earth became much hotter\u2014over 350\u00b0F\u2014as drillers dug deeper. Eventually, the drilling area became so hot that the drill bits melted. New holes would close as soon as they were dug. Realizing that better technology was needed, the team stopped drilling in 1994. The deepest hole ever drilled by humans was abandoned, but researchers at new sites continue to investigate the mysteries within Earth\u2019s crust.", "key_words": [{"word": "word", "translation": "--", "speech": "\u540d\u8bcd", "example": "N/A"}, {"word": "word", "translation": "--", "speech": "\u540d\u8bcd", "example": "N/A"}]}, "test": [{"type": "scq", "sentence": "Why were scientists able to learn new things from the kola superdeep borehole", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "They had not tried drilling holes before", "value": "They had not tried drilling holes before"}, {"text_en": "They devoted more money to the project", "value": "They devoted more money to the project"}, {"text_en": "It was the deepest they had ever explored", "value": "It was the deepest they had ever explored"}, {"text_en": "Holes dug elsewhere did not reveal much.", "value": "Holes dug elsewhere did not reveal much."}]}, {"type": "scq", "sentence": "Why did the project most likely need the skills of special drillers", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "The drilling project was unusual", "value": "The drilling project was unusual"}, {"text_en": "The tiny fossils needed careful handling", "value": "The tiny fossils needed careful handling"}, {"text_en": "Scientists knew little about earths crust", "value": "Scientists knew little about earths crust"}, {"text_en": "Special drillers stopped the holes from closing.", "value": "Special drillers stopped the holes from closing."}]}, {"type": "scq", "sentence": "What made the team realize they needed better technology to continue the work", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "The tools damaged the fossils", "value": "The tools damaged the fossils"}, {"text_en": "The heat melted the drill bits", "value": "The heat melted the drill bits"}, {"text_en": "Workers were not interested in the project", "value": "Workers were not interested in the project"}, {"text_en": "Water deposits ruined the drill.", "value": "Water deposits ruined the drill."}]}, {"type": "scq", "sentence": "The last sentence of the passage hints that ", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "Kola superdeep borehole was a waste of time", "value": "Kola superdeep borehole was a waste of time"}, {"text_en": "Superheated rock is found only in russia", "value": "Superheated rock is found only in russia"}, {"text_en": "Other research sites were also abandoned", "value": "Other research sites were also abandoned"}, {"text_en": "Discoveries are being made at other sites", "value": "Discoveries are being made at other sites"}]}]}
