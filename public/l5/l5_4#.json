        "sentence": "Jacob burst into the kitchen holding a deck of cards. “The great Jacob performs his most amazing trick yet!” he shouted. His little sister cooed and giggled from her highchair, but Jacob’s mom was less amused. “Could you show me in a minute?” she pleaded. “I’m trying to feed Emma.” “It’ll be quick,” Jacob responded. “Pick a card, any card!” he called out, spreading the cards into a fan shape. His mother sighed and pointed at a card. Jacob plucked the card from the fanned deck and stuck it onto his forehead. “I cannot see your card with my eyes,” he said, tapping his forehead with his finger, “but my mind’s eye will reveal it to me.

Jacob peeled the card off his forehead and shook Emma’s tiny hand. “My new assistant,” he said.",
