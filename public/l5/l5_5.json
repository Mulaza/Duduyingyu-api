{"lesson": {"type": "sentence", "title": "The Famous Rockettes", "sentence": "Imagine a long line of dancers performing a difficult high kick at exactly the same time. That was the vision of Russell Markert, who came up with the idea for the Rockettes back in 1925. The Rockettes, an all-female dance group, have come a long way with their high kicks. They have performed at the Radio City Music Hall in New York City since its opening in 1932. The goal of the Rockettes is for all of the dancers to make the same movements at the exact same time, as if they were one person rather than 36. This task requires a lot of practice, skill, and cooperation. The Rockettes perform in more than 200 shows over a two-month period. The schedule requires a huge commitment from the dancers. Over the years, more than 3,000 women have danced as Rockettes. They say that performing with the group is a dream come true, despite the long hours of practice and the demanding schedule. They love it when the audience stands and cheers.", "key_words": [{"word": "word", "translation": "--", "speech": "\u540d\u8bcd", "example": "N/A"}, {"word": "word", "translation": "--", "speech": "\u540d\u8bcd", "example": "N/A"}]}, "test": [{"type": "scq", "sentence": "According to the passage, what are the rockettes best known for", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "Their individual dance skills", "value": "Their individual dance skills"}, {"text_en": "Their training with russell markert", "value": "Their training with russell markert"}, {"text_en": "Their high kicks", "value": "Their high kicks"}, {"text_en": "Their demanding schedule", "value": "Their demanding schedule"}]}, {"type": "scq", "sentence": "Based on the passage, who was russell markert", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "A member of the audience", "value": "A member of the audience"}, {"text_en": "The founder of the rockettes", "value": "The founder of the rockettes"}, {"text_en": "The first male dancer in the rockettes", "value": "The first male dancer in the rockettes"}, {"text_en": "The owner of radio city music hall", "value": "The owner of radio city music hall"}]}, {"type": "scq", "sentence": "Which theme does the passage communicate", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "Dance is a good form of exercise", "value": "Dance is a good form of exercise"}, {"text_en": "Female and male dancers are different", "value": "Female and male dancers are different"}, {"text_en": "Many dancers can perform as if they were one", "value": "Many dancers can perform as if they were one"}, {"text_en": "Dance has changed over time.", "value": "Dance has changed over time."}]}, {"type": "scq", "sentence": "Based on the passage, what conclusion can you draw about the rockettes", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "It is easy to become a rockette", "value": "It is easy to become a rockette"}, {"text_en": "Men have recently joined the group", "value": "Men have recently joined the group"}, {"text_en": "They are popular with audiences today", "value": "They are popular with audiences today"}, {"text_en": "They were more popular in the past.", "value": "They were more popular in the past."}]}]}
