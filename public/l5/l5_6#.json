        "sentence": "As a young girl growing up in China, Juliana Chen never imagined the success she would have as a performer. At just 10 years old, she was chosen to attend the Hunan Academy for the Performing Arts. The Hunan Academy is one of China’s best schools for dancers, acrobats, and other kinds of performers. Juliana first trained in ballet. Then she studied juggling and acrobatics and joined a famous acrobatic troupe. But the work was physically difficult, and Juliana injured her leg several times. While she was recovering from one of her injuries, Juliana watched a magic show on television. That’s when Juliana knew she would become a magician. Juliana impressed people with her special skill. Because of her acrobatic training, she was skilled with her body and her hands. She could make cards appear out of thin air, it seemed. In 1986, Juliana won the All-China Best Magician competition. After her success in China, Juliana immigrated to Canada. There, she became an even bigger star. Soon, she traveled around the world, learning new tricks and performing in front of royalty. In 1997, she became the first woman and the first magician from China to win a world title for a solo act at the World Congress of Magicians, a major competition for magicians. Juliana continues to teach, perform, win awards, and learn new magic tricks.",
