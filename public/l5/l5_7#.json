        "sentence": "On most Sunday afternoons, Kelly and Alicia met in the treehouse of the big elm tree that grew between their backyards. Alicia brought a blanket to sit on, and Kelly brought snacks. On this warm June day, the girls looked down onto the lawns and driveways in their neighborhood. Usually they had trouble not talking at the same time. Today, neither said much. “Thanks for the snack,” Alicia said after a while. She was thinking about the next day. Her father had agreed to increase her allowance if she took care of the garden all summer. She wanted to earn enough money to pay for guitar lessons. But the garden was very big. “You’re welcome,” answered Kelly. She was thinking about summer school, which she would begin the next day. Kelly wanted to improve her math skills so she would have an easier time in sixth grade. The two girls sat glumly in their treehouse, thinking about the work ahead of them. “I wish we could trade places,” they both said suddenly. They looked at each other and began to laugh.",
