        "sentence": "When you think about competitions, you probably think of sports such as basketball and football. Not all serious competitive events are athletic, though. One example is the Rock Paper Scissors World Championship, in which contestants compete for large cash prizes. Rock Paper Scissors is a simple game between two players. Each player counts to three and then “throws” one hand forward, making one of three hand signals. A fist means “rock,” a flat hand means “paper,” and two extended fingers in a V shape means “scissors.” Rock wins against scissors, scissors wins against paper, and paper wins against rock. Although the game is simple, many players claim that they have developed complex strategies for winning. Some people might consider a Rock Paper Scissors contest to be strange. Around the world, though, people compete in many events that others think are crazy. In England, a 200-year-old competition sends hundreds of people running down a hill, chasing a giant wheel of cheese. In Finland, hopeful guitar heroes compete in the Air Guitar World Championships by strumming invisible guitars in front of an audience. Wales hosts the yearly World Bog Snorkelling Championships, in which contestants wear silly costumes—dressed, for example, like a mermaid or an octopus—and swim through dark, stinky bog water as the crowd cheers. These competitions are just a few of the crazy games that people play around the world. With some practice and training, maybe you could be a prize-winner in one of those contests yourself!",
