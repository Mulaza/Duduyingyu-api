{"lesson": {"type": "sentence", "title": "Crazy Contests", "sentence": "When you think about competitions, you probably think of sports such as basketball and football. Not all serious competitive events are athletic, though. One example is the Rock Paper Scissors World Championship, in which contestants compete for large cash prizes. Rock Paper Scissors is a simple game between two players. Each player counts to three and then \u201cthrows\u201d one hand forward, making one of three hand signals. A \"st means \u201crock,\u201d a #at hand means \u201cpaper,\u201d and two extended \"ngers in a V shape means \u201cscissors.\u201d Rock wins against scissors, scissors wins against paper, and paper wins against rock. Although the game is simple, many players claim that they have developed complex strategies for winning. Some people might consider a Rock Paper Scissors contest to be strange. Around the world, though, people compete in many events that others think are crazy. In England, a 200-year-old competition sends hundreds of people running down a hill, chasing a giant wheel of cheese. In Finland, hopeful guitar heroes compete in the Air Guitar World Championships by strumming invisible guitars in front of an audience. Wales hosts the yearly World Bog Snorkelling Championships, in which contestants wear silly costumes\u2014dressed, for example, like a mermaid or an octopus\u2014and swim through dark, stinky bog water as the crowd cheers. These competitions are just a few of the crazy games that people play around the world. With some practice and training, maybe you could be a prize-winner in one of those contests yourself!", "key_words": [{"word": "word", "translation": "--", "speech": "\u540d\u8bcd", "example": "N/A"}, {"word": "word", "translation": "--", "speech": "\u540d\u8bcd", "example": "N/A"}]}, "test": [{"type": "scq", "sentence": "The passage is mainly about ", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "Playing rock paper scissors", "value": "Playing rock paper scissors"}, {"text_en": "Playing sports around the world", "value": "Playing sports around the world"}, {"text_en": "Unusual competitions", "value": "Unusual competitions"}, {"text_en": "Popular ways for people to compete", "value": "Popular ways for people to compete"}]}, {"type": "scq", "sentence": "Where do the competitions mentioned in this passage occur", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "Mainly in england", "value": "Mainly in england"}, {"text_en": "All over the world", "value": "All over the world"}, {"text_en": "Only in europe", "value": "Only in europe"}, {"text_en": "Wherever people do not play basketball", "value": "Wherever people do not play basketball"}]}, {"type": "scq", "sentence": "The author probably thinks that the contests are strange because ", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "They have no rules", "value": "They have no rules"}, {"text_en": "They are dangerous", "value": "They are dangerous"}, {"text_en": "Cash prizes are small", "value": "Cash prizes are small"}, {"text_en": "The activities are silly", "value": "The activities are silly"}]}, {"type": "scq", "sentence": "How are the contests mentioned in the passage similar to basketball, football, or other sports", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "They all involve competition", "value": "They all involve competition"}, {"text_en": "They all require physical strength", "value": "They all require physical strength"}, {"text_en": "None offer prizes to winners", "value": "None offer prizes to winners"}, {"text_en": "None are entertaining", "value": "None are entertaining"}]}]}
