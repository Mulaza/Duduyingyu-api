Edmonds was born in Canada in 1841 and came to the United States in 1858. She disguised herself as Franklin Thompson and worked as a book salesman. In May 1861, one month after the Civil War began, she enlisted in the Second Michigan Infantry. For two years, Edmonds served in the army as Private Thompson. The Second Michigan Infantry fought in some important and violent battles, including First Bull Run in July 1861, Antietam in September 1862, and Fredericksburg in December 1862. Edmonds kept her gender a secret by sleeping in her own tent and sneaking off to bathe privately. Upon leaving the army, Edmonds resumed her real identity. She eventually revealed her service as Thompson in order to get a pension as a Civil War soldier. In 1886, the War Department recognized her as a female soldier who had served faithfully as a private during the war. She received the $12-a-month pension and was cleared of the desertion charge.
