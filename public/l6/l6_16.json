{"lesson": {"type": "sentence", "title": "Ephesus", "sentence": "Although tourists might think the best place to view Roman ruins would be the modern city of Rome, they would be mistaken. There is one city that helps visitors understand better than any other what it must have been like to live in the ancient Roman world. That city, in western Turkey, is Ephesus (EF-ih-sus). In Ephesus, visitors find fabulous ruins from around ad 100, such as the magnificent library and a theater that once seated 24,000 audience members. The ruins are among the best-preserved in the world and include houses, temples, and baths. Tourists can also visit ancient residences, complete with marble floors and frescoes painted on the walls. Ephesus used to serve as an important trading center for the Roman Empire because it had access to the Aegean Sea. However, the river that led to the Aegean filled with silt, and today Ephesus is miles inland. The city was deserted in the Middle Ages. Visitors to Ephesus can walk down a Roman road and see buildings that the ancient Romans saw. They can appreciate feats of engineering that are still impressive, such as the incredible acoustics in the huge open-air theater. Here, Roman audience members once listened to classical plays and watched gladiators fight. At Ephesus today, tourists can experience the ancient Roman Empire in its most inspiring form.", "key_words": [{"word": "word", "translation": "--", "speech": "\u540d\u8bcd", "example": "N/A"}, {"word": "word", "translation": "--", "speech": "\u540d\u8bcd", "example": "N/A"}]}, "test": [{"type": "scq", "sentence": "The author is mainly trying to .", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "Inform readers how ephesus has changed over time", "value": "Inform readers how ephesus has changed over time"}, {"text_en": "Persuade readers that ephesus is the best place to see roman ruins", "value": "Persuade readers that ephesus is the best place to see roman ruins"}, {"text_en": "Entertain readers with a story about ephesus", "value": "Entertain readers with a story about ephesus"}, {"text_en": "Compare the ruins in ephesus to the ruins in rome", "value": "Compare the ruins in ephesus to the ruins in rome"}]}, {"type": "scq", "sentence": "Unlike rome, the city of ephesus .", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "Was deserted in the middle ages", "value": "Was deserted in the middle ages"}, {"text_en": "Is still an important city", "value": "Is still an important city"}, {"text_en": "Was a major center of the ancient roman empire", "value": "Was a major center of the ancient roman empire"}, {"text_en": "Contains ancient ruins", "value": "Contains ancient ruins"}]}, {"type": "scq", "sentence": "Which one best describes the authors attitude toward ephesus?", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "The author is critical of ephesus.", "value": "The author is critical of ephesus."}, {"text_en": "The author is upset that ephesus was abandoned.", "value": "The author is upset that ephesus was abandoned."}, {"text_en": "The author thinks ephesus is important.", "value": "The author thinks ephesus is important."}, {"text_en": "The author is pleased that visitors prefer rome to ephesus.", "value": "The author is pleased that visitors prefer rome to ephesus."}]}, {"type": "scq", "sentence": "One theme of the passage is that .", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "It is important today to visit spiritual centers", "value": "It is important today to visit spiritual centers"}, {"text_en": "People can learn more from cities in the present than cities in the past", "value": "People can learn more from cities in the present than cities in the past"}, {"text_en": "Important civilizations developed near water", "value": "Important civilizations developed near water"}, {"text_en": "People can learn about the past by exploring ancient ruins", "value": "People can learn about the past by exploring ancient ruins"}]}]}
