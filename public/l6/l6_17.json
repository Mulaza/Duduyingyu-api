{"lesson": {"type": "sentence", "title": "Taking Action", "sentence": "At Seven Oaks Middle School, Daniela Carrera was searching for a club to join. There was a dance club, a choir, an exercise club, and an action club that found creative ways to raise money for other people. Daniela was thinking about joining the dance club because she loved dancing. Then Daniela\u2019s friend Ciara told her about the action club\u2019s new project. At first, Daniela was skeptical. \u201cWhy would people in a nursing home want a video-game console?\u201d she asked Ciara. \u201cThis would be a specific kind of console that plays fitness games. The games help people who need to exercise and move around but who can\u2019t get to a gym or exercise safely outdoors. Besides, everybody loves video games, don\u2019t they?\u201d Ciara replied. \u201cNot my great-grandmother,\u201d Daniela said, laughing. But she agreed to go to the club meeting the next day. At the meeting, Mr. Washington, the club\u2019s advisor, explained to Daniela and the others how fitness video games help motivate people to move. He described how the consoles can even help distract people who suffer from severe pain. That was all Daniela needed to hear. \u201cHow can I help?\u201d she asked as she signed up for the club. \u201cWe\u2019re selling raffle tickets. With the money we raise, we\u2019ll buy two fitness consoles. We\u2019ll give one to the winner of the raffle. We\u2019ll give the other console to the nursing home,\u201d explained Mr. Washington. \u201cGreat! Let\u2019s get started. I\u2019m motivated to sell some tickets today!\u201d said Daniela.", "key_words": [{"word": "word", "translation": "--", "speech": "\u540d\u8bcd", "example": "N/A"}, {"word": "word", "translation": "--", "speech": "\u540d\u8bcd", "example": "N/A"}]}, "test": [{"type": "scq", "sentence": "What is one theme of taking action?", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "It is important to help your family.", "value": "It is important to help your family."}, {"text_en": "Helping others is important.", "value": "Helping others is important."}, {"text_en": "Exercising is more important than having fun.", "value": "Exercising is more important than having fun."}, {"text_en": "When we fail, we must try again.", "value": "When we fail, we must try again."}]}, {"type": "scq", "sentence": "How is the action club different from the other clubs daniela could join?", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "You need to be invited to join the action club.", "value": "You need to be invited to join the action club."}, {"text_en": "You need to try out for the other clubs.", "value": "You need to try out for the other clubs."}, {"text_en": "In the action club, you raise money for causes.", "value": "In the action club, you raise money for causes."}, {"text_en": "In the other clubs, you make more friends.", "value": "In the other clubs, you make more friends."}]}, {"type": "scq", "sentence": "What is the authors main purpose for writing taking action?", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "To inform readers about nursing homes", "value": "To inform readers about nursing homes"}, {"text_en": "To describe clubs at a school", "value": "To describe clubs at a school"}, {"text_en": "To persuade readers to buy video games", "value": "To persuade readers to buy video games"}, {"text_en": "To tell readers a story about a club project", "value": "To tell readers a story about a club project"}]}, {"type": "scq", "sentence": "Which of the following is not a theme of the passage?", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "Doing good deeds will win you friends.", "value": "Doing good deeds will win you friends."}, {"text_en": "Working together, you can help others.", "value": "Working together, you can help others."}, {"text_en": "Young people can make a difference.", "value": "Young people can make a difference."}, {"text_en": "Friends can inspire each other to do good things.", "value": "Friends can inspire each other to do good things."}]}]}
