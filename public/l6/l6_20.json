{"lesson": {"type": "sentence", "title": "Prometheus", "sentence": "In ancient Greek mythology, Prometheus was a Titan, one of the most powerful gods. Yet even though he was a god, he found humans interesting. Zeus, the ruler of all the gods, did not care about human struggles, but Prometheus wanted to help mortals. According to the myths, Prometheus looked for ways to help humans solve their problems. For example, he taught people how to make bricks to build homes, how to tell the seasons by looking at the stars, and how to navigate their ships. Humans, with the help of Prometheus\u2019s knowledge, began to advance. They became more independent. Zeus ordered Prometheus not to help the humans, but Prometheus continued. After Prometheus stole fire from Zeus and gave it to people, Zeus grew incredibly angry. Until then, Zeus alone had controlled fire. By giving it to the humans, Prometheus was offering them the final power they needed to grow and prosper without the help of the gods. Zeus was furious. \u201cYou dared to defy me?\u201d cried Zeus. \u201cYou brought fire to those too foolish to use it properly. Now you must be punished!\u201d Zeus chained Prometheus to a mountain and sent an eagle to tear at his flesh. While Prometheus remained bound and helpless, the eagle ate his liver. Each day, the liver grew back, and the eagle attacked it anew. Prometheus\u2019s torture continued for years. Finally, Heracles, a brave warrior and one of Zeus\u2019s sons, could no longer stand to see Prometheus suffer. Heracles killed the eagle and set Prometheus free.", "key_words": [{"word": "word", "translation": "--", "speech": "\u540d\u8bcd", "example": "N/A"}, {"word": "word", "translation": "--", "speech": "\u540d\u8bcd", "example": "N/A"}]}, "test": [{"type": "scq", "sentence": "Which of these statements best tells the main idea of the passage?", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "Zeus and prometheus fought about heracles.", "value": "Zeus and prometheus fought about heracles."}, {"text_en": "Zeus told prometheus to avoid humans.", "value": "Zeus told prometheus to avoid humans."}, {"text_en": "Prometheus was chained to a mountain, and an eagle ate his liver.", "value": "Prometheus was chained to a mountain, and an eagle ate his liver."}, {"text_en": "Prometheus disobeyed zeus by sharing knowledge with humans.", "value": "Prometheus disobeyed zeus by sharing knowledge with humans."}]}, {"type": "scq", "sentence": "Which of these is the main idea of the second paragraph?", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "Prometheus wanted to see humans prosper.", "value": "Prometheus wanted to see humans prosper."}, {"text_en": "Prometheus thought humans were foolish.", "value": "Prometheus thought humans were foolish."}, {"text_en": "Zeus kept prometheus away from humans.", "value": "Zeus kept prometheus away from humans."}, {"text_en": "Prometheus helped humans, but they were ungrateful.", "value": "Prometheus helped humans, but they were ungrateful."}]}, {"type": "scq", "sentence": "Which detail explains why zeus finally decided to punish prometheus?", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "Prometheus gave fire to humans.", "value": "Prometheus gave fire to humans."}, {"text_en": "Prometheus was a titan.", "value": "Prometheus was a titan."}, {"text_en": "Prometheus taught humans to make bricks and build homes.", "value": "Prometheus taught humans to make bricks and build homes."}, {"text_en": "Prometheus got help from heracles.", "value": "Prometheus got help from heracles."}]}, {"type": "scq", "sentence": "Which of these details shows that prometheuss torture was ongoing?", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "Zeus chained prometheus to a mountain.", "value": "Zeus chained prometheus to a mountain."}, {"text_en": "Prometheuss liver grew back, and the eagle attacked it again and again.", "value": "Prometheuss liver grew back, and the eagle attacked it again and again."}, {"text_en": "Prometheus was bound and helpless.", "value": "Prometheus was bound and helpless."}, {"text_en": "Heracles killed the eagle and freed prometheus.", "value": "Heracles killed the eagle and freed prometheus."}]}]}
