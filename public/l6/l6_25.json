{"lesson": {"type": "sentence", "title": "Building A House Of Cards", "sentence": "One day after school, Phil and Curtis were thinking of something fun to do. \u201cLet\u2019s have a contest to see who can build the tallest house of cards,\u201d Phil suggested. \u201cOkay,\u201d said Curtis, \u201cbut you know I\u2019m the house-of-cards champion.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ll see,\u201d Phil said as he took two packs of cards from his desk. The two boys began working. Curtis first placed two cards so that they were touching each other at the top, making the shape of an upside-down V. Then, he did the same thing with two more cards, placing them beside the first pair. Soon, he had a line of cards that looked like teepees. Next, he placed cards flat across the tops of the teepees to make the foundation for the next level. Phil stood four cards on their edges to form a tall rectangle. Then, he placed cards flat on top of the rectangle to make the foundation for his next level. Now the brothers\u2019 troubles began. When Curtis tried to build his second level of teepees, he found that the cards on the bottom level would not stand. His teepees collapsed! When Phil tried to build his second level, the rectangle-shaped hut made of cards fell in a heap. \u201cWell, this is frustrating,\u201d said Phil. \u201cI have an idea,\u201d said Curtis. \u201cMaybe my teepees would work better on top of your rectangle.\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s try it!\u201d Phil said.", "key_words": [{"word": "word", "translation": "--", "speech": "\u540d\u8bcd", "example": "N/A"}, {"word": "word", "translation": "--", "speech": "\u540d\u8bcd", "example": "N/A"}]}, "test": [{"type": "scq", "sentence": "Why do phil and curtis want to build houses with cards?", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "They cannot find any other materials to build houses with.", "value": "They cannot find any other materials to build houses with."}, {"text_en": "They are thinking of something fun to do.", "value": "They are thinking of something fun to do."}, {"text_en": "They are in a contest with their friends.", "value": "They are in a contest with their friends."}, {"text_en": "They are doing a school project.", "value": "They are doing a school project."}]}, {"type": "scq", "sentence": "What happens when curtis starts to build a second level for his house of cards?", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "Phil says that he will help him.", "value": "Phil says that he will help him."}, {"text_en": "His house of cards falls apart.", "value": "His house of cards falls apart."}, {"text_en": "Phil knocks over the bottom level.", "value": "Phil knocks over the bottom level."}, {"text_en": "He wins the contest.", "value": "He wins the contest."}]}, {"type": "scq", "sentence": "Why is phil frustrated?", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "Curtis will not help him build his card house.", "value": "Curtis will not help him build his card house."}, {"text_en": "He runs out of cards for building his house.", "value": "He runs out of cards for building his house."}, {"text_en": "Both his and curtiss card houses fall.", "value": "Both his and curtiss card houses fall."}, {"text_en": "Curtiss card house is bigger than his.", "value": "Curtiss card house is bigger than his."}]}, {"type": "scq", "sentence": "What happens as a result of both phil and curtis having trouble building the second level?", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "They decide to work together.", "value": "They decide to work together."}, {"text_en": "They decide to stop building.", "value": "They decide to stop building."}, {"text_en": "They decide to start a new contest.", "value": "They decide to start a new contest."}, {"text_en": "They decide to ask for help.", "value": "They decide to ask for help."}]}]}
