{"lesson": {"type": "sentence", "title": "Dirty Job? Oh Yeah!", "sentence": "\u201cYou couldn\u2019t pay me to do that job!\u201d Have you ever said that? Some occupations are so gross that most people would never be willing to do them. Jeff Biggs has a job like that, but he likes it. He\u2019s the kind of guy who, as a kid, loved to slosh around in mud after a rainstorm, the kind of kid who loved squeezing oatmeal through his fingers. Biggs\u2019s dirty job is being a sewer inspector. \u201cBelieve me,\u201d says Biggs, \u201cgross doesn\u2019t come close to describing it; I creep, sometimes swim, through sewage all day.\u201d City sewers carry household wastewater and storm-drain runoff to water treatment plants. In addition to the unpleasant smells, sewer tunnels are home to creatures such as cockroaches and rats. And these creatures aren\u2019t shy. What is it like to do a really disgusting job day after day? \u201cSomeone has to do it,\u201d says Biggs. \u201cI seriously can\u2019t imagine sitting in an office all day, and I earn a good salary. At the end of my workday, I\u2019ve accomplished something, and I\u2019ve helped to keep our city\u2019s water clean and drinkable.\u201d And after work? \u201cI don\u2019t walk into the house right away,\u201d explains Biggs. \u201cWe installed the washing machine in the garage and put a shower stall in there, too. I toss my clothes into the washer, take a shower, and dress in clean clothes. Then I greet my family. Of course, sometimes, the clothes go into the trash, not the washer.\u201d", "key_words": [{"word": "word", "translation": "--", "speech": "\u540d\u8bcd", "example": "N/A"}, {"word": "word", "translation": "--", "speech": "\u540d\u8bcd", "example": "N/A"}]}, "test": [{"type": "scq", "sentence": "Which adjectives best describe jeff biggs?", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "Flashy, conceited, loud", "value": "Flashy, conceited, loud"}, {"text_en": "Positive, upbeat, thoughtful", "value": "Positive, upbeat, thoughtful"}, {"text_en": "Smart, wealthy, nervous", "value": "Smart, wealthy, nervous"}, {"text_en": "Negative, shy, withdrawn", "value": "Negative, shy, withdrawn"}]}, {"type": "scq", "sentence": "Which adjective best describes the setting in which biggs works?", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "Disgusting", "value": "Disgusting"}, {"text_en": "Boring", "value": "Boring"}, {"text_en": "Pleasant", "value": "Pleasant"}, {"text_en": "Appealing", "value": "Appealing"}]}, {"type": "scq", "sentence": "Which sentence best describes the central message of the passage?", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "Biggss job embarrasses him.", "value": "Biggss job embarrasses him."}, {"text_en": "Biggs cannot imagine having a nicer job.", "value": "Biggs cannot imagine having a nicer job."}, {"text_en": "Biggs is proud of the work he does.", "value": "Biggs is proud of the work he does."}, {"text_en": "Biggs is just doing his job until he gets a better one.", "value": "Biggs is just doing his job until he gets a better one."}]}, {"type": "scq", "sentence": "Which one would jeff biggs probably most enjoy being?", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "A lawyer", "value": "A lawyer"}, {"text_en": "A poet", "value": "A poet"}, {"text_en": "A computer programmer", "value": "A computer programmer"}, {"text_en": "A deep-sea diver", "value": "A deep-sea diver"}]}]}
