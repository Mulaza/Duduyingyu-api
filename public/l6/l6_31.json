{"lesson": {"type": "sentence", "title": "Crusader For Civil Rights", "sentence": "Fannie Lou Townsend was born in 1917 in Mississippi, the youngest of twenty children. She and her family were sharecroppers, moving from place to place to pick crops. Townsend toiled in the fields from the age of six. Her family was poor, and she often went hungry. But unlike most children of sharecroppers, Townsend went to school whenever she could, and after finishing sixth grade, she continued to study on her own. Townsend married Perry Hamer in 1944 and worked hard just to try to get by. Then, in 1962, she attended a meeting that changed her life. The meeting was held by the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC). Like other groups, such as the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), the SNCC used nonviolent means to try to end segregation in the South. One of their aims was to register African Americans to vote. At the time, Fannie Lou didn\u2019t realize African Americans had a constitutional right to vote. When she later went to register, she and others were jailed and beaten. She lost her job as a result and continued to be threatened with violence. Fannie Lou Hamer went on to work for the SNCC to help other African Americans register to vote. She was a founder of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party and spoke on television about the terrible effects of segregation. She was beaten and shot at over the years for her efforts, but she never gave up. Until her death in 1977, Fannie Lou struggled to help the poor and needy in her community and worked in politics to end discrimination.", "key_words": [{"word": "word", "translation": "--", "speech": "\u540d\u8bcd", "example": "N/A"}, {"word": "word", "translation": "--", "speech": "\u540d\u8bcd", "example": "N/A"}]}, "test": [{"type": "scq", "sentence": "How was fannie lou townsend different from most sharecroppers children?", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "She grew up in mississippi.", "value": "She grew up in mississippi."}, {"text_en": "She went to school.", "value": "She went to school."}, {"text_en": "She did not work in the fields.", "value": "She did not work in the fields."}, {"text_en": "She had enough to eat.", "value": "She had enough to eat."}]}, {"type": "scq", "sentence": "Why might the sncc meeting have changed fannie lous life?", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "She made new friends there.", "value": "She made new friends there."}, {"text_en": "She learned how to make more money.", "value": "She learned how to make more money."}, {"text_en": "She met her future husband there.", "value": "She met her future husband there."}, {"text_en": "She learned about fighting segregation.", "value": "She learned about fighting segregation."}]}, {"type": "scq", "sentence": "How were the sncc and the sclc similar?", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "Both were founded in part by fannie lou.", "value": "Both were founded in part by fannie lou."}, {"text_en": "Both provided free education to children.", "value": "Both provided free education to children."}, {"text_en": "Both used nonviolent means to end segregation.", "value": "Both used nonviolent means to end segregation."}, {"text_en": "Both were started to help sharecroppers.", "value": "Both were started to help sharecroppers."}]}, {"type": "scq", "sentence": "Based on information in the passage, fannie lou was someone who .", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "Had many opportunities", "value": "Had many opportunities"}, {"text_en": "Was afraid of change", "value": "Was afraid of change"}, {"text_en": "Did not give up easily", "value": "Did not give up easily"}, {"text_en": "Disliked people in power", "value": "Disliked people in power"}]}]}
