{"lesson": {"type": "sentence", "title": "The Blue Lagoon", "sentence": "I have always loved going to unique, out-of-the-way places, but the strangest place I\u2019ve ever visited was the Blue Lagoon in Iceland. The seawater of the Blue Lagoon is heated far beneath Earth\u2019s surface. Although most lagoons are natural, this one is man-made. A nearby power plant pumps the hot water up from a mile below the surface, through a lava formation. The water that\u2019s not used to make heat and electricity at the power plant is sent into the huge lagoon cut out of solid black rock formed from lava. The water is very warm\u2014about 104 degrees Fahrenheit. It\u2019s also full of minerals that make it appear a bright, shockingly blue color. When I visited, I walked along a pathway carved through rock, toward a bathhouse. There, I changed into a swimsuit and ran outside. The air was freezing, so I plunged into the lagoon, shivering. In a minute I was warm\u2014except for the top of my head, which was out of the water. Clouds of steam rose into the chilly air above the water so thickly that I could hardly see the dozens of other people bathing. The water felt silky, and I slathered an unusual mud on my face from wooden tubs around the lagoon. I rinsed the mud off under a hot waterfall. By the time I left, I was sure I would never experience anything stranger or more wonderful than the Blue Lagoon.", "key_words": [{"word": "word", "translation": "--", "speech": "\u540d\u8bcd", "example": "N/A"}, {"word": "word", "translation": "--", "speech": "\u540d\u8bcd", "example": "N/A"}]}, "test": [{"type": "scq", "sentence": "Which word best describes the narrator?", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "Timid", "value": "Timid"}, {"text_en": "Playful", "value": "Playful"}, {"text_en": "Curious", "value": "Curious"}, {"text_en": "Sarcastic", "value": "Sarcastic"}]}, {"type": "scq", "sentence": "Where is the passage mostly set?", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "In a hot seawater pool in iceland", "value": "In a hot seawater pool in iceland"}, {"text_en": "Under a waterfall at a hot spring", "value": "Under a waterfall at a hot spring"}, {"text_en": "Near a volcano in iceland", "value": "Near a volcano in iceland"}, {"text_en": "In a power plant in iceland", "value": "In a power plant in iceland"}]}, {"type": "scq", "sentence": "Based on information in the passage, which of these would you not expect to see at the blue lagoon?", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "Bright blue water", "value": "Bright blue water"}, {"text_en": "Fish swimming", "value": "Fish swimming"}, {"text_en": "People covered in mud", "value": "People covered in mud"}, {"text_en": "Clouds of steam", "value": "Clouds of steam"}]}, {"type": "scq", "sentence": "Which word best describes how the narrator feels about the blue lagoon?", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "Amused", "value": "Amused"}, {"text_en": "Frightened", "value": "Frightened"}, {"text_en": "Awed", "value": "Awed"}, {"text_en": "Confused", "value": "Confused"}]}]}
