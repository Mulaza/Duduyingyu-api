{"lesson": {"type": "sentence", "title": "A Musical Prodigy", "sentence": "Imagine knowing at age two what you want to do for the rest of your life. Jay Greenberg, nicknamed \u201cBluejay\u201d because these birds make a lot of noise for their size, did just that. He has been called the greatest musical talent to come along in 200 years. And all of this praise was said about a teenager! When Greenberg was just two years old, he started drawing pictures of musical instruments and wrote the word cello. His parents got him a cello, and by age three, he was composing music. In 2001, at age ten, he began attending the Julliard School, one of the world\u2019s best music conservatories, in New York City. Within two years, he had composed five symphonies. And by 2009, he had written more than 70 musical compositions for such groups as the New Haven Symphony and the London Symphony Orchestra. Greenberg is a musical prodigy, or extremely gifted young person. Unlike most kids, he doesn\u2019t download music from the Internet; he downloads it from his own mind! When he composes works, he hears them in his head complete, as if an orchestra were playing them. His hero is Beethoven, and for fun, he fools around with classical music compositions, changing and rewriting them. He is completely devoted to his calling, once telling his mother that he would die if he could not compose music.", "key_words": [{"word": "word", "translation": "--", "speech": "\u540d\u8bcd", "example": "N/A"}, {"word": "word", "translation": "--", "speech": "\u540d\u8bcd", "example": "N/A"}]}, "test": [{"type": "scq", "sentence": "Which words best describe jay greenberg?", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "Carefree and relaxed", "value": "Carefree and relaxed"}, {"text_en": "Anxious and withdrawn", "value": "Anxious and withdrawn"}, {"text_en": "Focused and gifted", "value": "Focused and gifted"}, {"text_en": "Uncertain and unhappy", "value": "Uncertain and unhappy"}]}, {"type": "scq", "sentence": "Which statement best describes a theme of the story?", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "Music appeals to all kinds of people.", "value": "Music appeals to all kinds of people."}, {"text_en": "You do not have to be an adult to have great talent.", "value": "You do not have to be an adult to have great talent."}, {"text_en": "Sometimes it is important to fit in.", "value": "Sometimes it is important to fit in."}, {"text_en": "Education helps people accomplish their goals.", "value": "Education helps people accomplish their goals."}]}, {"type": "scq", "sentence": "Jay greenbergs parents can probably be described as .", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "Stern", "value": "Stern"}, {"text_en": "Controlling", "value": "Controlling"}, {"text_en": "Trusting", "value": "Trusting"}, {"text_en": "Supportive", "value": "Supportive"}]}, {"type": "scq", "sentence": "Which of these is a theme of the story?", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "Kids should enjoy their childhood.", "value": "Kids should enjoy their childhood."}, {"text_en": "People should pursue things they are passionate about.", "value": "People should pursue things they are passionate about."}, {"text_en": "Being talented brings fame, as well as difficulties.", "value": "Being talented brings fame, as well as difficulties."}, {"text_en": "People must create balance in their lives.", "value": "People must create balance in their lives."}]}]}
