{"lesson": {"type": "sentence", "title": "Back From The Brink Of Extinction", "sentence": "The California condor is not a handsome bird. Its featherless scalp is a shocking pink-orange. Its feeding habits\u2014feasting on the flesh of dead animals\u2014should not be mentioned at the dinner table. So why do naturalists at Arizona\u2019s Grand Canyon want to protect this bird? These huge vultures were once found across North America from Mexico to Canada. But by 1982, only 22 existed in the world and the species faced extinction. By 1985, only nine California condors remained. Because the loss of one species can affect a whole ecosystem, naturalists sprang into action. They decided to capture the remaining condors to begin a captive breeding program. As females produced eggs, some eggs were removed and raised by people, using a hand puppet that looked like a condor head. This was done to keep chicks from imprinting on humans, or thinking humans were their parents. Naturalists wanted the chicks to feel safe with other condors, not with humans. The captive population increased dramatically. Then, beginning in 1992, newly bred chicks were released into the wild. In 1996, two males and four females were released 30 miles north of the Grand Canyon. In 2004, the first condor that had been hatched and raised in Arizona in more than a century took flight. Although it died in 2006, others have since hatched and taken flight. Today, around 60 California condors soar majestically above northern Arizona\u2019s canyon country.", "key_words": [{"word": "word", "translation": "--", "speech": "\u540d\u8bcd", "example": "N/A"}, {"word": "word", "translation": "--", "speech": "\u540d\u8bcd", "example": "N/A"}]}, "test": [{"type": "scq", "sentence": "What would probably have happened to the condors without a captive breeding program?", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "They would have stopped breeding.", "value": "They would have stopped breeding."}, {"text_en": "They would have become extinct.", "value": "They would have become extinct."}, {"text_en": "The population would have gradually increased.", "value": "The population would have gradually increased."}, {"text_en": "They would have evolved into a new species.", "value": "They would have evolved into a new species."}]}, {"type": "scq", "sentence": "What would happen if a condor chick were to imprint on humans?", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "It might escape from captivity.", "value": "It might escape from captivity."}, {"text_en": "It might attack humans.", "value": "It might attack humans."}, {"text_en": "It might reject food given to it by humans.", "value": "It might reject food given to it by humans."}, {"text_en": "It might lose its natural fear of humans.", "value": "It might lose its natural fear of humans."}]}, {"type": "scq", "sentence": "What is likely to happen to california condors in the future?", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "Their diet will change.", "value": "Their diet will change."}, {"text_en": "Their numbers will continue to grow.", "value": "Their numbers will continue to grow."}, {"text_en": "They will begin helping people.", "value": "They will begin helping people."}, {"text_en": "Females will stop laying eggs.", "value": "Females will stop laying eggs."}]}, {"type": "scq", "sentence": "What are naturalists most likely to do if another species is close to becoming extinct?", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "Begin breeding them in captivity", "value": "Begin breeding them in captivity"}, {"text_en": "Capture them, and release them in arizona", "value": "Capture them, and release them in arizona"}, {"text_en": "Breed them with a related species", "value": "Breed them with a related species"}, {"text_en": "Let nature take its course", "value": "Let nature take its course"}]}]}
