{"lesson": {"type": "sentence", "title": "Deadly In The Water", "sentence": "Jellyfish can be beautiful to look at as they float gracefully in the sea. But most jellyfish have a painful sting, and one variety of jellyfish is considered the most dangerous living creature in the world. This creature, the sea wasp of Australia, can kill a large fish or even a human in minutes. Sea wasps aren\u2019t the biggest jellyfish, but they can grow as large as a basketball. They have up to 60 long tentacles. The tentacles can dangle 15 feet down into the water and are loaded with thousands of stinging cells. When the sea wasp\u2019s tentacles brush up against an animal, chemicals on the animal\u2019s skin trigger the release of the sea wasp\u2019s venom. The venom affects the nerves and heart of the prey. Usually the sea wasp uses its venom on fish, which it then eats. But sometimes humans are unlucky enough to come into contact with a sea wasp\u2019s tentacles. These victims can suffer excruciating pain, nausea, breathing problems, and occasionally even death. Australians have developed an antivenom to treat the sea wasp\u2019s stings. Like the antivenom used for poisonous snake bites, it counteracts the poison from the sting. But there is an easier, although very unusual way to avoid stings in the first place. Australian lifeguards and surfers often wear women\u2019s pantyhose on their arms and legs! This thin layer of nylon prevents sea wasps from touching people\u2019s skin, which keeps the tentacles from releasing their venom.", "key_words": [{"word": "word", "translation": "--", "speech": "\u540d\u8bcd", "example": "N/A"}, {"word": "word", "translation": "--", "speech": "\u540d\u8bcd", "example": "N/A"}]}, "test": [{"type": "scq", "sentence": "What is the passage mostly about?", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "What jellyfish are like", "value": "What jellyfish are like"}, {"text_en": "A kind of jellyfish called the sea wasp", "value": "A kind of jellyfish called the sea wasp"}, {"text_en": "How to avoid jellyfish stings", "value": "How to avoid jellyfish stings"}, {"text_en": "Ways jellyfish hunt their prey", "value": "Ways jellyfish hunt their prey"}]}, {"type": "scq", "sentence": "Which of these details would be best to add to paragraph 2?", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "The sea wasp is one of several kinds of box jellyfish.", "value": "The sea wasp is one of several kinds of box jellyfish."}, {"text_en": "When swimming in australia, watch out for tentacles!", "value": "When swimming in australia, watch out for tentacles!"}, {"text_en": "You can use vinegar to make a sea wasp release its tentacles from your skin.", "value": "You can use vinegar to make a sea wasp release its tentacles from your skin."}, {"text_en": "The tentacles of a sea wasp can contain up to 5,000 stinging cells.", "value": "The tentacles of a sea wasp can contain up to 5,000 stinging cells."}]}, {"type": "scq", "sentence": "According to the passage, australian lifeguards deal with the problem of sea wasps by .", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "Wearing pantyhose to prevent stings", "value": "Wearing pantyhose to prevent stings"}, {"text_en": "Putting antivenom on their skin", "value": "Putting antivenom on their skin"}, {"text_en": "Swimming when sea wasps are less active", "value": "Swimming when sea wasps are less active"}, {"text_en": "Staying out of the water", "value": "Staying out of the water"}]}, {"type": "scq", "sentence": "According to information in the passage, how do sea wasps attack their prey?", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "They brush up against it.", "value": "They brush up against it."}, {"text_en": "They chase it down.", "value": "They chase it down."}, {"text_en": "They crush it with their tentacles.", "value": "They crush it with their tentacles."}, {"text_en": "They shoot venom at it.", "value": "They shoot venom at it."}]}]}
