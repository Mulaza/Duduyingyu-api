{"lesson": {"type": "sentence", "title": "Rain In Space?", "sentence": "One of the most thrilling and dangerous jobs of an astronaut is the spacewalk\u2014leaving a spacecraft and floating in space while connected to the craft by a tether. One astronaut, Alexander Kaleri, took a spacewalk that was even more exciting and perilous than he had planned. On February 26, 2004, Kaleri and Commander Mike Foale were at the International Space Station in orbit around Earth. They planned to leave the space station to perform a list of repairs and experiments. It was the 52nd spacewalk at the space station. At 4:17 pm, the hatch of the docking module opened, and the men began their spacewalk. The astronauts had five hours to complete their work. Everything proceeded normally until 7:23 pm. At that time, Kaleri reported to Mission Control that there was water inside his spacesuit, saying, \u201cI have rain inside the helmet. I have water inside the visor.\u201d He also reported that the water was \u201cquite some amount, a significant amount. It felt like rain.\u201d Immediately, officials on the ground grew worried. They found that a cooling device in the suit was not working correctly. They ordered the astronauts to return quickly to the space station, and by 8:12, the two men were back inside. It was the first spacesuit malfunction on a spacewalk\u2014but it ended happily, with both astronauts safe and unhurt.", "key_words": [{"word": "word", "translation": "--", "speech": "\u540d\u8bcd", "example": "N/A"}, {"word": "word", "translation": "--", "speech": "\u540d\u8bcd", "example": "N/A"}]}, "test": [{"type": "scq", "sentence": "What is paragraph 3 mostly about?", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "The dangers of spacewalks", "value": "The dangers of spacewalks"}, {"text_en": "Astronaut alexander kaleri", "value": "Astronaut alexander kaleri"}, {"text_en": "Events during the 52nd spacewalk", "value": "Events during the 52nd spacewalk"}, {"text_en": "A visit to the international space station", "value": "A visit to the international space station"}]}, {"type": "scq", "sentence": "How long did the spacewalk last?", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "About 2 hours", "value": "About 2 hours"}, {"text_en": "About 4 hours", "value": "About 4 hours"}, {"text_en": "About 5 hours", "value": "About 5 hours"}, {"text_en": "About 52 hours", "value": "About 52 hours"}]}, {"type": "scq", "sentence": "What happened to kaleris spacesuit?", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "The cooling system malfunctioned.", "value": "The cooling system malfunctioned."}, {"text_en": "There was a hole in the sleeve.", "value": "There was a hole in the sleeve."}, {"text_en": "It did not fit him correctly.", "value": "It did not fit him correctly."}, {"text_en": "It leaked during a storm in space.", "value": "It leaked during a storm in space."}]}, {"type": "scq", "sentence": "What would be another good title for the passage?", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "The international space station", "value": "The international space station"}, {"text_en": "The many dangers of space", "value": "The many dangers of space"}, {"text_en": "Why spacewalks fail", "value": "Why spacewalks fail"}, {"text_en": "A memorable spacewalk", "value": "A memorable spacewalk"}]}]}
