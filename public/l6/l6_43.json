{"lesson": {"type": "sentence", "title": "Skeleton On The Ice", "sentence": "Zooming downhill on a sled can be incredibly thrilling. But what if you were going eighty miles an hour? That\u2019s how fast the world\u2019s best competitors go in the sport of skeleton. Skeleton competitors wear tight, stretchy uniforms that help lower wind resistance. They also wear helmets and goggles for protection. They need this special equipment for speed and safety while zipping down an icy track with hairpin turns. Each skeleton sled holds one person. To take off, the athlete sprints as fast as possible, pushing the sled. Then the slider dives headfirst onto the sled, lying on his or her stomach. There is no steering or brakes on a skeleton. The slider steers the skeleton by shifting his or her body weight. Skeleton began in 1892 in St. Moritz, Switzerland. Toboggans, which are long wooden sleds, were already popular, but the early skeleton sled was made mostly of metal. It looked like a skeleton, which may be how the sport got its name. The first skeleton race occurred in 1905. In 1928, when the Olympics were held in St. Moritz, skeleton became an Olympic sport. An American, Jennison Heaton, won the gold medal. The Olympics included skeleton again in 1948. In 2000, the sport underwent another change when women began competing at the World Championships. The sport was part of the Olympics once again at the 2002 Games in Salt Lake City, Utah, when it became a permanent part of the winter Olympics. This dangerous sport with the spooky name is now practiced on a competitive level by men and women in 30 countries.", "key_words": [{"word": "word", "translation": "--", "speech": "\u540d\u8bcd", "example": "N/A"}, {"word": "word", "translation": "--", "speech": "\u540d\u8bcd", "example": "N/A"}]}, "test": [{"type": "scq", "sentence": "The first thing an athlete does to get the skeleton sled started on a run is .", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "Extend his or her head and feet off the sled", "value": "Extend his or her head and feet off the sled"}, {"text_en": "Dive onto the sled", "value": "Dive onto the sled"}, {"text_en": "Sprint while pushing the sled", "value": "Sprint while pushing the sled"}, {"text_en": "Shift his or her body weight", "value": "Shift his or her body weight"}]}, {"type": "scq", "sentence": "Toboggans were invented .", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "Before 1892", "value": "Before 1892"}, {"text_en": "In 1905", "value": "In 1905"}, {"text_en": "In 1928", "value": "In 1928"}, {"text_en": "After 1948", "value": "After 1948"}]}, {"type": "scq", "sentence": "When did skeleton first appear in the olympics, and when did it reappear?", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "1892, 1905", "value": "1892, 1905"}, {"text_en": "1928, 1948", "value": "1928, 1948"}, {"text_en": "1905, 1928", "value": "1905, 1928"}, {"text_en": "1948, 2000", "value": "1948, 2000"}]}, {"type": "scq", "sentence": "Which event happened last in skeleton?", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "It became a permanent olympic sport.", "value": "It became a permanent olympic sport."}, {"text_en": "Women began competing.", "value": "Women began competing."}, {"text_en": "It made its second olympic appearance.", "value": "It made its second olympic appearance."}, {"text_en": "Jennison heaton won a gold medal.", "value": "Jennison heaton won a gold medal."}]}]}
