{"lesson": {"type": "sentence", "title": "Not Quite The Same", "sentence": "When most people want to see what they look like, they look in a mirror. I don\u2019t need a mirror to see myself, though. I can just look at my identical twin sister, Sarita. Sarita and I have always worn our hair the same way\u2014long and straight, with bangs. We have the same dark eyes and big smile, and we both have one crooked tooth on the right. We both love the color green, hate eating fish, and think mayonnaise is disgusting. We play the violin, and every year we compete with each other for the position of first violin in the school orchestra. In some ways, however, we\u2019re totally different. Sarita always wears funky hats, which I think is really weird. She thinks it\u2019s strange that I like jazz music. Some people say that our biggest difference is that Sarita is in a wheelchair. She was in a car accident when she was very young, and her spine was badly injured. To me, however, the real difference between us is that Sarita has courage and determination. She has never let being in a wheelchair slow her down, and she\u2019s almost never angry or unhappy about what happened to her. So when I look in the mirror, I see myself\u2014Celia\u2014but I also see Sarita, a better version of me. She\u2019s the me I try to be.", "key_words": [{"word": "word", "translation": "--", "speech": "\u540d\u8bcd", "example": "N/A"}, {"word": "word", "translation": "--", "speech": "\u540d\u8bcd", "example": "N/A"}]}, "test": [{"type": "scq", "sentence": "What is the passage mostly about?", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "How twins compete", "value": "How twins compete"}, {"text_en": "How sarita was injured", "value": "How sarita was injured"}, {"text_en": "How the twins are similar and different", "value": "How the twins are similar and different"}, {"text_en": "How celia feels about sarita", "value": "How celia feels about sarita"}]}, {"type": "scq", "sentence": "How are celia and sarita similar?", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "They both wear funky hats.", "value": "They both wear funky hats."}, {"text_en": "They both play violin.", "value": "They both play violin."}, {"text_en": "They both love eating fish.", "value": "They both love eating fish."}, {"text_en": "They both love jazz music.", "value": "They both love jazz music."}]}, {"type": "scq", "sentence": "Which one is a difference between the twins?", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "Sarita is more determined.", "value": "Sarita is more determined."}, {"text_en": "Celia has shorter hair.", "value": "Celia has shorter hair."}, {"text_en": "Sarita has a bigger smile.", "value": "Sarita has a bigger smile."}, {"text_en": "Celia has darker eyes.", "value": "Celia has darker eyes."}]}, {"type": "scq", "sentence": "Celia wants to be like sarita because she .", "hint": "N/A", "answer": ["-----"], "card_data": [{"text_en": "Is jealous of saritas talents", "value": "Is jealous of saritas talents"}, {"text_en": "Thinks sarita is prettier", "value": "Thinks sarita is prettier"}, {"text_en": "Wants to be a better violinist", "value": "Wants to be a better violinist"}, {"text_en": "Admires saritas attitude", "value": "Admires saritas attitude"}]}]}
